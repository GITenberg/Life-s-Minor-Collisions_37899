<h2>WHY MINOR?</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Collisions</span> are measured by what they
will smash. Potentially, all collisions
are major. A slight blow will explode
a bomb. But since most of us do not
commonly carry dynamite through the
busy sections of this life, we can take
a good many brisk knocks and still
survive.</p>

<p>The collisions, though dealt with in
separate chapters by two of us, are seldom
between two people alone. They
are collisions, mostly minor, between
the individual and the group, the individual
and circumstances, the individual
and the horse he rides on.</p>

<p>All the chapters are for those kindred
spirits who try to be easy to live
with&mdash;and find it difficult.</p>

<h2>LOVE'S MINOR FRICTIONS</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/cap-m.png" width="148" height="149" alt=""/></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Minor</span> friction is the kind
that produces the most
showy results with the
smallest outlay. You can
stir up more electricity in a cat by
stroking her fur the wrong way than
you can by dropping her into the well.
You can ruffle the dearest member of
your family more by asking him twice
if he is <em>sure</em> that he locked the back
door than his political opponents could
stir him with a libel. We have direct
access to the state of mind of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" title="2"> </a>
people with whom we share household
life and love. Therefore, in most homes,
no matter how congenial, a certain
amount of minor friction is inevitable.</p>

<p>Four typical causes of minor friction
are questions of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tempo</i>, the brotherly
reform measure, supervised telephone
conversations, and tenure of parental
control. These are standard group-irritants
that sometimes vex the sweetest
natures.</p>

<p>The matter of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tempo</i>, broadly considered,
covers the whole process of adjustment
between people of hasty and
deliberate moods. It involves alertness
of spiritual response, alacrity in taking
hints and filling orders, timely appreciations,
considerate delays, and all the
other delicate retards and accelerations
that are necessary if hearts are to beat
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"> </a>
as one. But it also includes such homely
questions as the time for setting out for
places, the time consumed in getting
ready to set out, and the swiftness of
our progress thither. When a man who
is tardy is unequally yoked with a wife
who is prompt, their family moves
from point to point with an irregularity
of rhythm that lends suspense to
the mildest occasions.</p>

<p>A certain architect and his wife Sue
are a case in point. Sue is always on
time. If she is going to drive at four,
she has her children ready at half-past
three, and she stations them in the
front hall, with muscles flexed, at ten
minutes to four, so that the whole
group may emerge from the door like
food shot from guns, and meet the incoming
automobile accurately at the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>
curb. Nobody ever stops his engine
for Sue. Her husband is correspondingly
late. Just after they were married,
the choir at their church gambled
quietly on the chances&mdash;whether she
would get him to church on time, or
whether he would make her late. The
first Sunday they came five minutes
early, the second ten minutes late, and
every Sunday after that, Sue came
early, Prescott came late, and the
choir put their money into the contribution-box.
In fact, a family of this
kind can solve its problem most neatly
by running on independent schedules,
except when they are to ride in the
same automobile or on the same train.
Then, there is likely to be a breeze.</p>

<p>But the great test of such a family's
grasp of the time-element comes when
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>
they have a guest who must catch a
given car, due to pass the white post at
the corner at a quarter to the hour.
The visit is drawing to a close, with five
minutes to spare before car-time. Those
members of the family who like to wait
until the last moment, and take their
chances of boarding the running-board
on the run, continue a lively conversation
with the guest. But the prompt
ones, with furtive eye straying to the
clock, begin to sit forward uneasily in
their chairs, their faces drawn, pulse feverish,
pondering the question whether
it is better to let a guest miss a car or
seem to hurry him away. The situation
is all the harder for the prompt contingent,
because usually they have behind
them a criminal record of occasions
when they have urged guests to the curb
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
in plenty of time and the car turned out
to be late. The runners and jumpers of
the family had said it would be late, and
it was late. These memories restrain
speech until the latest possible moment.
Then the guest is whisked out to the
white post with the words, &ldquo;If you
<em>could</em> stay, we'd be delighted, but if
you really <em>have</em> to make your train&mdash;&rdquo;
Every punctual person knows the look
of patronage with which the leisured
classes of his family listen to this old
speech of his. They find something
nervous and petty about his prancing
and pawing, quite inferior to their large
oblivion. As Tagore would say, &ldquo;They
are not too poor to be late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The matter of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tempo</i> involves also the
sense of the fortunate moment, and the
timing of deeds to accord with moods.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>
In almost every group there is one
member who is set at a slightly different
velocity from the others, with a momentum
not easily checked. When the rest
of the household settles down to pleasant
conversation, this member thinks
of something pressing that must be done
at once.</p>

<p>The mother of three college boys is
being slowly trained out of this habit.
Her sons say that she ought to have
been a fire-chief, so brisk is she when
in her typical hook-and-ladder mood.
Whenever her family sits talking in the
evening, she has flitting memories of
things that she must run and do. One
night, when she had suddenly rushed
out to see if the maid had remembered
to put out the milk tickets, one of the
boys was dispatched with a warrant for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>
her arrest. He traced her to the door of
the side porch, and peered out at her in
the darkness. &ldquo;What's little pussy-foot
doing now?&rdquo; he inquired affectionately.
&ldquo;Can she see better in the dark? Come
along back.&rdquo; But her blood was up.
She thought of several other duties
still waiting, and went at once to the
kitchen and filled the dipper. With
this she returned to the room where
sat the waiting conversationalists, and
systematically watered the fern. It
was like wearing orange to a Sinn Fein
rally. At the chorus of reproach she
only laughed, the scornful laugh of the
villain on the stage. Six determined
hands seized her at once. The boys
explained that, when they wanted to
talk to her, it was no time to water
ferns. As habitual breaker-up of public
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>
meetings, she was going to be reformed.</p>

<p>But the reform measure, a group-irritant
second to none, is generally
uphill business in the home. Welfare
work among equals is sometimes imperative,
but seldom popular. Any
programme of social improvement implies
agitation and a powerful leverage
of public opinion not wholly tranquillizing
to the person to be reformed.</p>

<p>There is one family that has worked
for years upon the case of one of its
members who reads aloud out of season.
When this brother William finds a
noble bit of literature, he is fired to
share it with his relatives, regardless
of time and circumstances. He comes
eagerly out of his study, book in hand,
when his public is trying on a dress.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>
Or he begins to read without warning,
when all the other people in the room
are reading something else. Arguments
and penalties never had the slightest
effect, until one of the company hit
upon a device that proves a defensive
measure in emergencies.</p>

<p>Brother William started suddenly
to read aloud from a campaign speech.
His youngest sister was absorbed in
that passage in &ldquo;Edwin Drood&rdquo; called
&ldquo;A Night With Durdles,&rdquo; where Jasper
and Durdles are climbing the cathedral
spire. In self-defence she also began to
read in a clear tone as follows: &ldquo;Anon,
they turn into narrower and steeper
staircases, and the night air begins to
blow upon them, and the chirp of some
startled jackdaw or frightened rook
precedes the heavy beating of wings in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>
a confined space, and the beating down
of dust and straws upon their heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea spread like wildfire. All the
others opened their books and magazines
and joined her in reading aloud
from the page where they had been
interrupted. It was a deafening medley
of incongruous material&mdash;a very
telling demonstration of the distance
from which their minds had jumped
when recalled to the campaign speech.
Brother William was able to distinguish
in the uproar such fragments as these:
&ldquo;Just at that moment I discovered four
Spad machines far below the enemy
planes&rdquo;; &ldquo;&lsquo;Thankyou thankyou,&rsquo; cried
Mr. Salteena&mdash;&rdquo;; &ldquo;Thomas Chatterton
Jupiter Zeus, a most dear wood-rat&rdquo;;
and &ldquo;&lsquo;It is natural,&rsquo; Gavin said
slowly, &lsquo;that you, sir, should wonder
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>
why I am here with this woman at such
an hour.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This method did not work a permanent
cure, because nothing ever cures
the reader-aloud. His impulse is generosity&mdash;a
mainspring of character, not
a passing whim. But at a crisis, his
audience can read aloud in concert.</p>

<p>The reform measure is more hopeful
when directed, not at a rooted trait, but
at a surface phase or custom. Even here
success is not without its battles. My
sister Barbara and I were once bent
upon teaching our younger brother
Geoffrey to rise when ladies entered the
room. Geoffrey, then at the brigand
age, looked at this custom as the
mannerism of an effete civilization. He
rose, indeed, for guests, but not as to
the manner born. One day he came
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>
home and reported that the lady next
door had introduced him to an aunt of
hers who had just arrived on a visit.
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said he, with speculative eye
upon his sisters, &ldquo;<em>I didn't get up to be
introduced.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The effect was all that heart could
wish. Tongues flew. Geoffrey listened
with mournful dignity, offering no
excuse. He waited until our sisterly
vocabulary was exhausted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn't you ask me where I
was when she introduced me?&rdquo; he
asked at length. &ldquo;I was crawling along
the ridgepole of her garage catching her
cat for her, and I couldn't get up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But we were not easily diverted
from our attempts to foster in him the
manly graces. We even went so far
as to invite Geoffrey to afternoon tea-parties
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>
with our friends. But a Tea-Lion,
he said, was one thing that he was
not. On such occasions he would be
found sitting on the kitchen table
dourly eating up the olives and refusing
to come in. We were too young in those
days to know that you cannot hurry a
certain phase. But now, when we meet
our brother at receptions, we smile at
our former despair. Reformers often
find their hardest tasks taken out of
their hands by time.</p>

<p>Few brothers and sisters, however,
are willing to trust to time to work its
wonders. There is a sense of fraternal
responsibility that goads us to do what
we can for each other in a small way.
The friction that ensues constitutes an
experience of human values that the
hermit in his cell can never know.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>
Whenever people of decided views feel
personally responsible for each other's
acts, a type of social unrest begins to
brew that sometimes leads to progress
and sometimes leads to riots.</p>

<p>For this reason, in any home that
aspires to peace at any price, the telephone
should be installed in a sound-proof
box-office with no glass in the
door. There is nothing that so incenses
a friendly nature as a family grouped
in the middle-distance offering advice
when a telephone conversation is going
on. The person at the receiver looks
so idle; there seems to be no reason why
he should not listen with his unoccupied
ear; and, when he is so evidently in need
of correct data, it seems only kind to
help him out. It is the most natural
thing in the world to listen. The family
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>
listens, in the first place, to find out
which one of them is wanted, and they
continue to listen to find out what is
said. When the wrong thing is said,
all loyal relatives feel responsible.</p>

<p>The person telephoning is unfairly
handicapped by necessary politeness,
because he can be heard through the
transmitter and his advisers cannot.
Only extreme exasperation can unleash
his tongue, as happened once when
Geoffrey, in our father's absence, undertook
to answer a telephone call while
Barbara, in the next room, corrected
his mistakes.</p>

<p>Geoffrey, pricking both ears, was
doing very well, until the lady at the
other end of the line asked a question
at the exact moment when Barbara
offered a new thought. &ldquo;What did you
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>
say?&rdquo; inquired Geoffrey. Both Barbara
and the lady repeated. &ldquo;What is
it?&rdquo; said Geoffrey, waving one foot
at Barbara. Barbara, not seeing the
foot, repeated, and so did the lady, this
time more distinctly. &ldquo;I beg your
pardon,&rdquo; said Geoffrey anxiously, &ldquo;but
what did you say?&rdquo; Like an incredible
nightmare the thing happened again.
&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; roared Geoffrey; &ldquo;what did
you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara, recognizing instantly that
part of the message directed to her,
wrote her suggestion on the telephone
pad and stole prudently away. Minor
friction, she had learned, can sometimes
lead to action on a large scale. Only after
some such experience as this do we allow
a kinsman to conduct his own telephone
conversations, taking his own responsibilities,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>
running his own dark risks.</p>

<p>But the sense of mutual responsibility
is, after all, the prime educational
factor in family life. Every good parent
has a feeling of accountability for the
acts of his children. He may believe in
self-determination for the small States
about him, but after all he holds a
mandate. The delightful interweaving
of parental suggestion with the original
tendencies of the various children is
the delicate thing that makes each family
individual. It is also the delicate
thing that makes parenthood a nervous
occupation. When parental suggestion
is going to interweave delightfully as
planned, and when it is not going to
interweave at all, is something not foretold
in the prophets.</p>

<p>The question of parental influence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>
becomes more complex as the family
grows older and more informally organized.
Sometimes a son or daughter
wants to carry out a pet project without
any advice or warning or help from
anybody. There is nothing rash or
guilty about his plan. He simply
happens to be in the mood to act,
not in committee, but of himself. To
achieve this, surrounded by a united
and conversational family, becomes a
game of skill. To dodge advice, he
avoids the most innocent questions. At
such times as these, the wisest parents
wonder what they have done to forfeit
confidence. They see this favorite
son of theirs executing the most harmless
plans with all the secrecy of the
young poisoning princes of the Renaissance.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>When this happens, the over-sensitive
parent grieves, the dictatorial parent
rails, but the philosophical parent picks
up whatever interesting morsels he can
on the side, and cocks a weather eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert seems to have a good many
engagements,&rdquo; wrote the mother of a
popular son in a letter to an absent
daughter, &ldquo;but whether the nature of
the engagements is social, athletic, or
philanthropic, we can only infer from
the equipment with which he sets out.
I inferred the first this morning when
he asked me to have his dress-suit sent
to be pressed; but I could not be certain
until Mrs. Stone said casually that
Robert was to be a guest at Mrs.
Gardiner's dinner next week. Don't
you love to see such tender intimacy
between mother and son?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>Secrecy of this kind is not the monopoly
of sons. Excellent young women
have chopped ice and frozen sherbet
behind closed doors because they did
not want to be told again not to get the
ice all over the back piazza. Certain
warnings go with certain projects as
inevitably as rubbers with the rain.
The practised mother has so often
found the warnings necessary, that the
mere sight of the act produces the
formula by rote. Model sons and
daughters should accept these hints
with gratitude, thus avoiding all friction,
however minor. But rather than
be advised to do that which they were
planning to do already, the most loyal
of daughters will resort to clandestine
measures, and go stealthily with the
ice-pick as with a poniard beneath a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
cloak. This annoys an affectionate and
capable mother very much. And she
has a right to be annoyed, has she not?
After all, it is her ice-pick.</p>

<p>There is something of spirited affection
about the memory of all these early
broils. They were heated enough at the
time, for the most violent emotions
can fly out at a trifling cause. Remarks
made in these turbulent moments are
often taken as a revelation of your true
and inward self. The sentiments that
you express in your moment of wrath
sound like something that you have
been repressing for years and are
now turning loose upon an enlightened
world. There is an air of desperate
sincerity about your remarks that
makes your hearers feel that here, at
last, they have the truth.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>With friends, after such an outburst,
you could never feel quite the same
again. But with your relatives, such
moments can be lived down&mdash;as once
occurred in our own family when our
father one hot summer day sent Geoffrey
back to town to perform a forgotten
errand. I had not heard of the event
until I took my place at table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's Geoffrey?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sent him back to get a letter he
forgot,&rdquo; said my father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In all this heat?&rdquo; I protested.
&ldquo;Well, if I had been in his place, I'd
have gone away and stayed away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you could,&rdquo; said my father
serenely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will,&rdquo; said Little Sunshine,
and walked out of the door and up the
street in a rage.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>After you have left your parental
home as suddenly as this, there comes
a moment when you have the sensation
of being what is termed &ldquo;all dressed up
with no place to go.&rdquo; You feel that
your decision, though sudden, is irrevocable,
because going back would
mean death to your pride. You try to
fight off the practical thought that you
can hardly go far without hat or scrip.
Therefore, when Geoffrey met his eloping
sister at the corner, it was with
some little diplomacy that he learned
my history and took me back to the
table under his wing. The conversation
barely paused as we took our places.
Our father went on affably serving the
salad to the just and the unjust alike.
If, at this point, I had been treated with
the contumely that I deserved, the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
memory would be unpleasant in the
minds of all. As it is, the family now
mentions it as the time when Margaret
ran away to sea.</p>

<p>The only thing that can make minor
friction hurtful is the disproportionate
importance that it can assume when it
is treated as a major issue, or taken as
an indication of mutual dislike. It is
often an indication of the opposite,
though at the moment the contestants
would find this hard to believe. Kept
in its place, however, we find in it later
a great deal of humorous charm, because
it belongs to a period when we
dealt with our brethren with a primitive
directness not possible in later
years. An intricate ambition, this
matter of harmony in the home.
Ideally, every family would like to have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>
a history of uninterrupted adorations
and exquisite accord. But growth
implies change, change implies adjustment,
and adjustment among varied
personalities implies friction. Kept at
the minimum, kept in its place, such
friction does not estrange. Instead, it
becomes a means to an intimate acquaintance
with one another's traits
and moods&mdash;an intimacy of understanding
not far remote from love.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>BOSTON STREETS</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/cap-i.png" width="149" height="151" alt=""/></div>

<p class="drop-cap drop-i1"><span class="upper-case">I am</span> trying to learn how
to get from the Majestic
Theatre to the South Station.
I am convinced that
in time I might be able to learn this,
if I were not also trying at the same
time to learn how to get from the
Hollis Street Theatre to the Dennison
Manufacturing Company on Franklin
Street.</p>

<p>I suppose that trying to solve two
problems simultaneously is always confusing.
A student trying to compute
problems with both hands at the same
time&mdash;problems dealing respectively
with yards and pounds&mdash;might ultimately
confuse his inches with ounces.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
Similarly, I confuse Eliot Street and
Essex, Kneeland and Otis.</p>

<p>My brother Geoffrey who goes with
me to Boston thinks that this is funny;
that is, he thinks it something appalling
that should be remedied. In consequence
of this, he draws for me a series
of beautiful little sketches on an envelope
he has about him. He letters the
roads meticulously with a fountain
pen, traces our route-to-be with little
arrows, and then flings me heartlessly
into the Boston Streets.</p>

<p>Boston Streets, and Boston Streets
on an envelope, are not alike at all. On
the envelope, the streets are simple
lines, all related to each other; in
reality, each street is an individual
personality, distracting you from a
noble grasp of the Whole, by presenting
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>
the sole gigantic unit of itself, further
complicated by detail. Geoffrey is not
bothered by a unit, or by a detail. He
branches from one street into another
with as sure an instinct as a cat who
retraces on foot a journey once traversed
in a bag.</p>

<p>This is not because he <em>knows</em> Boston,
but because he has a <em>capacity</em> for Boston.
He leads me patiently over one
route a great many times, verifying
our position at intervals with reference
to his map. After a day at my books,
I am faint-heartedly supposed to have
comprehended a fact. When this actually
takes place, it is very hard for
me to conceal my pride in any trifling
bit of erudition which I may have
accidentally picked up about Boston.
Once I distinctly remember saying to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>
Geoffrey, &ldquo;Do you want to walk down
to the Colonial Theatre or shall we go
by Subway?&rdquo; Since we were at that
time near the entrance of a suitable
subway, my good brother stared at me
in radiant expectation. I fear that he
hoped that I was at last laying a slight
hold on a working knowledge of his
favorite city. But his hope was unfounded,
for this glimmer of mine was
one of only four facts that I have
actually been able to learn about the
crooked miles in Boston.</p>

<p>The remaining three truths are here
recorded for the curious.</p>

<p>I know the Public Library, from any
angle, without map or guide, by its fair
face alone, and how to reach it from the
station at Back Bay. (This, in such a
meagre description of Boston, might
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>
perhaps qualify as two distinct facts.)
I know that if one walks far enough
past the Library, in the direction in
which the lady with the black ball is
looking, one will eventually come to
Commonwealth Avenue, where eozoic
cabbies may be seen. And now that we
have unearthed, on our way back to the
station, the Copley Theatre, I am sure
that I could go to Boston, friendless,
find this theatre, lunch across the street,
and retrace my steps to some proper
railway.</p>

<p>It may seem to the observer that I
am abnormally interested in finding
my way to the theatres. I am. This is
my primary reason for going to Boston
at all; and surely it is a quiet wish to do
a little shopping and get a lunch before
the play begins. Therefore, our main
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>
interest lies in locating, on each trip,
one theatre and one depot. Then, if
time permits, I am supposed to articulate
a shop of some kind from the
tangle of Butterfly Boxes, Corner Book
Stores, and Florist windows, and some
sort of hostelry where we can eat. If
my guide is less obdurate than usual
about compelling me to find my way
without his assistance, he shows me
the front steps of a Department Store
<em>once</em>. Then I am supposed to know
that store for all time, when viewing
it from all angles&mdash;from its front door,
its back door, its basement, and from
its roof. I am supposed to know what
store I am in from the looks of the elevator
boys. It always gives me acute
pain to disappoint a valued friend.
Hence, in a department store, I suffer.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>
Once inside the store, I can find my
way about very easily. I merely do not
know what street I am on.</p>

<p>There are certain things in Boston
about which even Geoffrey inquires.
This concession on his part, instead of
bringing him down to my fallible
human level, instantly elevates him to
a still higher caste. He makes his
inquiries of policemen, and he understands
what they say. When a policeman
directs <em>me</em>&mdash;solitary&mdash;to go up
one street and down another, and mixes
in a little of the Public Garden or the
Common, I cannot carry his kind words
in my mind, even with the aid of a
mnemonic. He cannot direct me from
the known to the unknown, because I
know nothing. He cannot explain to
me; he has to go with me. I do not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>
know the Common from the Public Garden.
They both look like gardens to me,
both equally public, and neither, common.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; protests my brother, &ldquo;the
Public Garden is regular&mdash;a rectangle.
And the Common is irregular&mdash;a trapezium.&rdquo;
This is perfectly true on the
envelope (now dirty). But when you
are in the park itself, you are not especially
aware of its shape. Individual
pigeons are more obvious. The park is
too big to look square.</p>

<p>In just this same way, Washington
Street is too big to look parallel. When
you are on Washington Street, and it
alone, it is not blindingly parallel to
anything, unless, perhaps, the other
side of itself. And if my policeman, on
his pretty horse, should tell me that
that was Tremont Street, I should
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>
believe him. Boston has done as bad.
It would be no stranger than it is
to spring miraculously from Summer
Street into Winter, simply by following
it across the road. In fact, I was not
aware that we had changed streets at
all, when on my maiden trip through
this section. I preserved to the end
an hallucination that I was still on
Summer Street.</p>

<p>Perhaps a few will do me the
magnificent honor of absolving me
from boasting, when I say that I am
capable of apprehending really nice
bits of information in other walks of
life;&mdash;other than Boston walks. I can
pick you out a pneumonia germ from
under the microscope, and count your
red corpuscles for you. I can receive
the Continental Code by wireless, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>
play on a violoncello. I can get a baby
to sleep.</p>

<p>But I cannot tell you where you are
in Boston. There are people who would
not admit this. They would set themselves,
with their faces steadfastly toward
the Hub, to learn. Geoffrey is
one of these. But I have neither the
time nor the proper shoes. I readily
admit that Boston is too much for me
at my age. So I take my brother with
me. Then I placidly relegate Boston
Streets to that list of things
which I am constitutionally unable to
learn:&mdash;how to tat, just what is a
Stock, and what a Bond, and the difference
between a Democrat and a
Republican.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37"> </a>TO HORSE</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/cap-a.png" width="150" height="151" alt=""/></div>

<p class="drop-cap drop-wide"><span class="upper-case"><span class="invisible">&ldquo;A</span> duck</span>,&rdquo; we used to read
in the primer at school,
&ldquo;a duck is a long low
animal covered with feathers.&rdquo;
Similarly, a horse is a long high
animal, covered with confusion. This
applies to the horse as we find him in
the patriotic Parade, where a brass-band
precedes him, an unaccustomed
rider surmounts him, and a drum-corps
brings up his rear.</p>

<p>In our own Welcome Home Parade,
after the boys returned from France,
the Legion decided to double the number
of its mounted effectives: all the
overseas officers should ride. All the
overseas officers were instantly on their
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>
feet. Their protests were loud and
heated. A horse, they said, was something
that they personally had never
bestridden. They offered to ride anything
else. They would fly down the
avenue in Spads, or do the falling leaf
over the arch of triumph. They would
ride tanks or motor-cycles or army-trucks.
But a horse was a thing of independent
locomotion, not to be trifled
with. It was not the idea of getting
killed that they objected to, it was the
looks of the thing. By &ldquo;the thing,&rdquo;
they meant not the horse, but the
rider.</p>

<p>In spite of the veto of the officers,
the motion was carried by acclamation.
The mediæval charm of a mounted
horse-guard instantly kindled the community
imagination. The chaplain,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>
fresh from the navy, was promised a
milk-white palfrey for his especial use,
if he would wear his ice-cream suit for
the occasion.</p>

<p>There was no time to practise before
the event, but the boys were told
to give themselves no anxiety about
mounts. Well-bred and competent
horses would appear punctually just
before the time for falling in. The officers
were instructed to go to a certain
corner of a side street, find the fence
behind the garage where the animals
would be tied, select their favorite form
of horse from the collection they would
see there, and ride him up to the green.</p>

<p>When Geoffrey came home and said
that he was to ride a horse in the procession,
our mother, who had been a
good horsewoman in her girlhood, took
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>
him aside and gave him a few quiet
tips. Some horses, she said, had been
trained to obey certain signals, and
some to obey the exact opposite. For
instance, some would go faster if you
reined them in, and some would slow
down. Some waited for light touches
from their master's hand or foot, and
others for their master's voice. You had
to study your horse as an individual.</p>

<p>Geoffrey said that he was glad to
hear any little inside gossip of this
sort, and made his way alone to
the place appointed, skilfully dodging
friends. We gathered that if he had to
have an interview with a horse, he preferred
to have it with nobody looking
on.</p>

<p>The fence behind the garage was
fringed with horses securely tied, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>
the top of the fence was fringed with a
row of small boys, waiting. Geoffrey
approached the line of horses, and
glanced judicially down the row. Books
on &ldquo;Reading Character at Sight&rdquo; make
a great point of the distinctions between
blond and brunette, the concave
and the convex profile, the glance of the
eye, and the manner of shaking hands.
Geoffrey could tell at a glance that the
handshake of these horses would be
firm and full of decision. As one man
they turned and looked at him, and
their eyes were level and inscrutable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which of these horses,&rdquo; said he to
the gang on the fence-top, &ldquo;would you
take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one!&rdquo; said an eager spokesman.
&ldquo;He didn't move a muscle since they
hitched 'im.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>This recommendation decided the
matter instantly. Repose of manner
is an estimable trait in the horse.</p>

<p>Geoffrey looked his animal over
with an artist's eye. It was a slender
creature, with that spare type of beauty
that we associate with the Airedale dog.
The horse was not a blond. The stirrups
hung invitingly at the sides. Geoffrey
closed the inspection with satisfaction,
and prepared to mount.</p>

<p>In mounting, does one first untie
one's horse and then get on, or may one,
as in a steam-launch, get seated first
and then cast off the painter? Geoffrey
could not help recalling a page from
&ldquo;Pickwick Papers,&rdquo; where Mr. Winkle
is climbing up the side of a tall horse at
the Inn, and the 'ostler's boy whispers,
&ldquo;Blowed if the gen'l'man wasn't for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>
getting up the wrong side.&rdquo; Well, what
governs the right and wrong side of
a horse? Douglas Fairbanks habitually
avoids the dilemma by mounting from
above&mdash;from the roof of a Mexican
monastery, for instance, or the fire-escape
of an apartment house. From
these points he lands, perpendicularly.
With this ideal in mind, Geoffrey
stepped on from the fence, clamped his
legs against the sides of the horse, and
walked him out into the street.</p>

<p>When I say that he walked him out
into the street, I use the English language
as I have seen it used in books,
but I think that it was an experienced
rider who first used the idiom. Geoffrey
says that he did not feel, at any
time that afternoon, any sensation of
walking his horse, or of doing anything
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>
else decisive with him. He walked, to
be sure, dipping his head and rearing
it, like a mechanical swan. But on a
horse you miss the sensation of direct
control that you have with a machine.
With a machine, you press something,
and if a positive reaction does not
follow, you get out and fix something
else. Not so with the horse. When you
get upon him you cut yourself off from
all accurately calculable connection
with the world. He is, in the last analysis,
an independent personality. His
feet are on the ground, and yours are
not.</p>

<p>We bow to literary convention, therefore,
when we say that Geoffrey walked
his horse.</p>

<p>Far ahead of him, he saw the khaki
backs of two of his friends who were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a>
also walking their horses. One by one
they ambled up to the green and took
places in the ranks. Geoffrey discovered
that his horse would stand well
if allowed to droop his long neck and
close his eyes. Judged as a military
figure, however, he was a disgrace
to the army. If you drew up the reins
to brace his head, he thought it a signal
to start, and you had to take it all
back, hastily. With the relaxed rein
he collapsed again, his square head
bent in silent prayer.</p>

<p>With the approach of the band,
however, all this changed. He reared
tentatively. Geoffrey discouraged that.
Then he curled his body in an unlovely
manner&mdash;an indescribable gesture, a
sort of sidelong squirm in semi-circular
formation. His rider straightened
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>
him out with a fatherly slap on the
flank.</p>

<p>It was time to start. The band led
off. Joy to the world, thought the
horse, the band is gone. The rest of the
cavalry moved forward in docile files,
but not he. If that band was going
away, he would be the last person to
pursue it. Instead of going forward,
he backed. He backed and backed.
There is no emergency brake on a
horse. He would have backed to the
end of the procession, through the
Knights of Columbus, the Red Cross,
the Elks, the Masons, the D.A.R., the
Fire Department, and the Salvation
Army, if it had not been for the drum-corps
that led the infantry. The drum-corps
behind him was as terrifying as
the band in front. To avoid the drum-corps,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>
he had to spend part of his
time going away from it. Thus his
progress was a little on the principle
of the pendulum. He backed from the
band until he had to flee before the
drums.</p>

<p>The ranks of men were demoralized
by needless mirth. Army life dulls the
sensibilities to the spectacle of suffering.
They could do nothing to help, except
to make a clear passage for Geoffrey as
he alternately backed from the brasses
and escaped from the drums. Vibrating
in this way, he could only discourse
to his horse with words of feigned affection,
and pray for the panic to pass off.
With a cranky automobile, now, one
could have parked down a side street,
and later joined the procession, all
trouble repaired. But there was nothing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>
organic the matter with this horse.
Geoffrey could not have parked him in
any case, because it would have been
no more possible to turn him toward
the cheering crowds on the pavement
than to make him follow the band. The
crowds on the street, in fact, began to
regard these actions as a sort of interesting
and decorative manœuvre, so
regular was the advance and retirement&mdash;something
in the line of a
cotillion. And then the band stopped
playing for a little. Instantly the horse
took his place in the ranks, marched
serenely, arched his slim neck, glanced
about. All was as it should be.</p>

<p>Geoffrey's place was just behind the
marshal, supposedly to act as his aide.
During all this absence from his post
of duty, the marshal had not noticed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>
his defection or turned around at all.
Now he did so, hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just slip back, will you,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and tell Monroe not to forget the
orders at the reviewing stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Geoffrey opened his mouth to explain
his disqualifications as courier,
but at that moment the band struck
up, and his charger backed <ins title="precipitatly">precipitately</ins>.
The marshal, seeing this prompt
obedience to his request, faced front,
and Geoffrey was left steadily receding,
no time to explain&mdash;and the drum-corps
was taking a vacation. There
was, therefore, no reason for the horse
ever to stop backing, unless he should
back around the world until he heard
the band behind him again. As he
backed through the ranks of infantry,
Geoffrey shouted the marshal's message
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>
to the officer of the day. He had
to talk fast&mdash;ships that pass in the
night. But the message was delivered,
and he could put his whole mind on his
horse.</p>

<p>He tried all the signals for forward
locomotion that he could devise. Mother
had told him that some horses
wait for light touches from their master's
hand or foot. Geoffrey touched
his animal here and there, back of the
ear&mdash;at the base of the brain. He
even kicked a trifle. He jerked the
reins in Morse Code and Continental,
to the tune of S&nbsp;O&nbsp;S. The horse understood
no codes.</p>

<p>They were now in the ranks of the
Knights of Columbus, and the marching
boys were making room for them
with shouts of sympathetic glee. Must
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>
they back through the Red Cross, where
all the girls in town were marching, and
into the Daughters of the Revolution
float where our mother sat with a
group of ladies around the spinning-wheel?
Geoffrey remembered that the
Red Cross had a band, if it would only
play. It struck up just in time. The
horse instantly became a fugitive in
the right direction. On they sped, the
reviewing stand almost in sight. The
drum-corps had not begun to play.
Could they reach the cavalry before it
was too late? Geoffrey hated to pass
the reviewing stand in the guise of a
deserter, yet here he was cantering
among the Odd Fellows, undoubtedly
A.W.O.L.</p>

<p>But Heaven was kind. The drums
waited. Through their ranks dashed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>
Geoffrey at full speed, and into the
midst of his companions. The reviewing
stand was very near. At a signal, all
bands and all drums struck up together.
The horse, in stable equilibrium at last,
daring not to run forward or to run
backward, or to bolt to either side,
fell into step and marched. Deafening
cheers, flying handkerchiefs; Geoffrey
and his horse stole past, held in the
ranks by a delicate balance of four-cornered
fear. If you fear something
behind you and something in front of
you, and things on both sides of you,
and if your fear of all points of the
compass is precisely equal, you move
with the movements of the globe.
Geoffrey's horse moved that way past
the stand.</p>

<p>People took their pictures. Our
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>
father, beaming down from the galaxy
on the stand, was pleased. Later he told
Geoffrey how well he sat his horse.</p>

<p>But that evening Geoffrey had a
talk with his mother, as man to man.
He told her that, if these Victory
Parades were going to be held often,
he should vote for compulsory military
training for the horse. He told her the
various things his horse had done, how
he went to and fro, going to when
urged fro, and going fro when urged
not to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably he had been trained to
obey the opposite signals,&rdquo; said our
mother. &ldquo;You must study your horse
as an individual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That horse was an individual. Geoffrey
studied him as such. He is quite
willing to believe that he had been
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>
trained to obey the opposite signals.
But Geoffrey says that he still cannot
stifle one last question in his mind:&mdash;signals
opposite to what?</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>WHEELS AND HOW THEY GO ROUND</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/cap-i.png" width="149" height="151" alt=""/></div>

<p class="drop-cap drop-i2"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is a simple matter, I
have been told, to keep
a locomotive running
smoothly on its track,
once it is well coaled-up and started.
In an artistic moment in a summer
vacation, Margaret and I likened our
house and all its simple well-oiled
machinery to a locomotive&mdash;Mother
and Carrie being the engineer.</p>

<p>Therefore, we accepted rather
blandly the charge of the house and
grounds while the engineer took a
vacation. I rather think we had it in
mind to look in occasionally upon the
house as it ran along, and to save the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>
bulk of the day for other things. We
were already accustomed to the complexities
of a house; we had officiated
at each separate complexity. But I am
not sure that we did not plan to run the
house a trifle more nonchalantly than
the average anxious housewife, and
welcome both our daily duties and any
unexpected guests with a minimum of
morbid foreboding.</p>

<p>The first thing we noticed after we
were left alone was a little steady drip
in the back room. This was the refrigerator
leaking. When this fact had
once been agreed upon, Margaret and
I began to see with eyes of the mind
fragments of motion pictures in which
the refrigerator was being fixed. It is
queer what vague remnants of a scene
will stay with you, when at the time of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>
the scene you were not responsible for
the outcome. Margaret, from her ever-active
and interesting memory, called
up Mother's dream-shape at the silcock,
all ready to turn on the garden-hose.
I dimly remembered Carrie with
her arm under the refrigerator holding
the hose and calling respectfully from
the back room&mdash;&ldquo;All ready, mum.&rdquo;
So we hatched a plot and proceeded to
act it.</p>

<p>We had to assume the pipe at the
rear of the ice-box, for we could not see
it. We assumed also that it was plugged
up. I had chanced once upon Carrie,
lying prone on a rug in the back room,
directing the nozzle of the hose into
this inaccessible pipe-hole near the
farther wall. I elected to plumb for
the hole, with Margaret to run about
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>
alternately holding matches for me and
working the spray. My arms are the
longer; her fear of fire is somewhat
less. After I had found the hole,
Margaret attached the hose to the
silcock outside the house, threaded it
through the screen door, passed the
nozzle to me, and went back to turn on
the water. Hose in hand, face averted,&mdash;prone,&mdash;I
waited. Prone means
on your face. If you turn your head to
look under the refrigerator, your arm
is not long enough. I directed the water
almost wholly by the Braille system.
Why it should have entered into the
heart of man to construct a refrigerator
so deep that the arm of man is not long
enough to reach its drain, will have to
be explained to us when we reach the
city four-square. But a good workman
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" title="59"> </a>
never finds fault with his tools, Margaret
said, so we set to work with what
Nature offered us.</p>

<p>I soon found that no cue was needed
for some of my lines. My manner of
shouting, &ldquo;Turn it off!&rdquo; was extremely
unstudied;&mdash;art disguising art. Twice
the back room was inundated. I
became a saturated solution. I felt
like the brave boy of Haarlem. Margaret
came in and advanced the theory
that, when you have reached a certain
stage of wetness, it does not matter at
all how much more water you lie in.
Acting on this supposition, and with
my consent, she turned on all the city's
water-power with great suddenness.
I shall always think that this did make
a difference in my wetness, but it dislodged
the obstruction. We could hear
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60"> </a>
the glad water leaping and gurgling
through the pipe out of doors.</p>

<p>Why this pipe should have had any
connection with the boiler and attendant
pipes behind the stove remains
forever shrouded in mystery. These
pipes began to leak on the morning of
the second day, and we sent for a
plumber. He pronounced us unpatchable,
unsolderable. Margaret and I
convened. We decided, in committee
of the whole, to be re-piped and
re-boilered. We did not know then
that the plumbers were going to find still
more serious trouble with the pipes that
led to the main. Were we justified in
ordering complete repairs? Our eternal
query of Life became, &ldquo;What would
Mother do?&rdquo; We went the whole figure&mdash;well
up into three figures.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>It was not until the third day that
we succeeded in making our nonchalance
at all prominent. We invited a
guest to supper, nonchalantly. She
was not the type of guest that you take
into the kitchen and tie an apron
around. In her honor, we decided to
have, among other things, popovers
and cherry pie. We decided that we
could conventionally have popovers
because the hour was really a supper
hour; that we might have cherry pie because
the meal was really a dinner. To
make this strange plan at all intelligible,
I shall have to state that, as far
as our names are known, we are famous
for our popovers and our cherry pie.
We were at our nonchalant best.</p>

<p>Our cherry tree is a unique specimen
among the vegetables. It has a curious
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>
short, gnarled trunk just as a cherry
tree should; but, aside from that, it
runs along the general lines of a spirea.
Each main branch, nearly six inches
in diameter at the point of departure,
sprangles instantly into showers of
fragile twigs. These in turn branch
gracefully higher and higher, occasional
cherries on the outskirts. To pick our
cherries, one really ought to be a robin.
Each cherry has an exquisite red cheek
and a black ant running to and fro
across it.</p>

<p>We chose Margaret to pick the
cherries. We chose her because she is
lighter than I by half a stone; and we
thought the fewer stone on the twigs,
the better. Then it was going to be her
pie.</p>

<p>The cherries which could be reached
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>
from the ground were satisfactory in
the extreme. They rattled into the pail,
just as other people's cherries rattle. It
would have been my instinct to leave
these till the last. But I was not picking
the cherries. I found it impossible,
however, to stay away from the cherry-picking.
Margaret is rather quick in
some of her mannerisms. And her mannerism
of mounting our cherry tree was
little short of lightning. She was wearing
white silk hose and white canvas
slippers. Personally I did not consider
these correct climbing shoes, but Margaret
is accustomed, when far from home,
to choose her own boots for all occasions,
and to pay for new ones when her
choice proves disastrous. So I watched
her rise above me without remark.</p>

<p>I freely admit that it always seems
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>
less dangerous to one whose feet can
feel the crotches on the tree, and on
whose arm the tin pail is, than to the
anxious relative on the ground below.
As Margaret's manœuvres transmitted
unpleasant little cracks along the tree,
I recalled bits of sage advice that I had
on a time given to my mother concerning
her attitude when Geoffrey was
climbing trees. I had told Mother that
Geoffrey was just as safe in a tree as in
his bed. But Margaret did not give
this reassuring appearance. Perhaps I
like Margaret better than I do Geoffrey.
Certainly I was more afraid she would
fall out of the cherry tree.</p>

<p>She finally passed out of my sight.
After a prolonged interval of silence,
I suggested to Margaret that she come
down.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>&ldquo;My foot is caught,&rdquo; returned my
sister, her tone of voice wholly explanatory.
&ldquo;It won't come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shoe tapers to a point,&rdquo; I
called encouragingly. &ldquo;Try to turn it
sideways and pull backwards at the
same time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barbara,&rdquo; said my sister tonelessly,
&ldquo;I just said it wouldn't come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you'll have to take your foot
out, and leave the slipper up there,&rdquo;
I responded with finality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would Mother do?&rdquo; called
Margaret from her lady's bower.</p>

<p>It was so obvious, even to me, that
Mother would not have been up a tree
at this hour that I could only repeat
my original project of abandoning the
slipper. I learned afterwards that it is
not an entirely uncomplicated process
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66"> </a>
to buckle in the centre when swinging
in a tree-top with one foot stationary
and a tin pail on one's arm, and untie
a slipper-strap without tipping the pail
or falling out of the tree. Margaret
soon appeared within my line of vision,
listing dangerously, chastened, dignified,
and stocking-footed. She reminded
me simultaneously, as she descended,
of a mystic Russian première danseuse,
a barefooted native swinging
down his cocoanut grove, and High
Diddle Dumpling my son John.</p>

<p>I was rash enough later to inquire
into the mechanics of retrieving the
slipper, but Margaret, as she finished
her tart, replied so appropriately in the
words of the Scriptures as to be too
sacrilegious to repeat.</p>

<p>As our nonchalant day wore on, I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>
lighted the gas-oven for popovers. Popovers
are casuals. They are not supposed
to be a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d'œuvre</i>. They are the
high-grade moron of the hot-bread family.
A guest expects the popovers to be
good, just as he expects the butter to
be good. I expected mine to be good.</p>

<p>As they neared the crisis, the city
gas was shut off. I acted instantly,
treating the phenomenon as a rare
exception in housekeeping. I aroused
a dying fire in the coal range with great
speed and an abundance of kindling,
and conveyed my gems across kitchen.
It is a sweet-tempered popover, indeed,
which will bear shifting from a hot
oven to a moderately comfortable one.
I began steadily to lose my unconcern.
Once on my knees before an oven door,
I usually ask no quarter and receive
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68"> </a>
no advice. Advice is sometimes given
me, but my advisers realize that it is
not being received. This time I called
Margaret in consultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they are going to pop,&rdquo; she
pronounced judicially, &ldquo;but not over.&rdquo;
She was right.</p>

<p>Does Life hold, I wonder, a more
sorrowful moment than that time when
a true cook has to instruct her guest
to scoop out the inside of her popover
for the chickens, and eat only the
outside? Every one knows that delicate
tinkling sound that a good popover
makes when tossed on a china plate.
These made somewhat the same sound
as a Florida orange. We learned quite
cogently that evening that Hospitality
may depend, not upon greatness of
heart, but upon the gas stove.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" title="69"> </a>This experience of ours, however,
could not be regarded strictly as a test
case. Any one would admit that all of
our adversity was unusual. It is the
rare exception when all the pipes in the
house burst at once, when there is no
gas in the gas-stove, and when one
loses a slipper in making a cherry pie.</p>

<p>It took another day to show us that
running a house <em>normally</em> consists in
dealing with a succession of unusual
events.</p>

<p>We did not court disaster, or attempt
anything ambitious. We had not even
planned to invite any more company.
But an old friend of Geoffrey's appeared
at our door in uniform with his
new wife, to wait over a train. Margaret
promptly invited them to lunch.
Our lunch, as already planned, was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" title="70"> </a>
simple. We told them that it would be
simple. Margaret leans, during hot
weather, to such things as iced tea,
lettuces, cheese wafers, and simple
frozen desserts. Fiction has it that the
water-ices are the simplest of anything.
They <em>are</em> simple to eat. We had
planned to freeze the water-ice together.
But in view of the fact that we had
company, Margaret, who had first
suggested our simple dessert, slipped
quietly out to freeze it alone.</p>

<p>Ice may be cold stuff, but it is
heating to chop. Three minutes may
freeze a pudding in some freezers, but
not in ours. As much time wore away,
I gradually hitched my chair in a backward
direction, to permit a stealthy
glance at Margaret on the back piazza.
It is almost as wearing to hold
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>
our freezer down as it is to turn the
crank. Margaret was doing both at
once, stopping frequently to chase a
slippery chunk of ice about with her
pick, chivying the bits of ice and salt
finally into a cup. Her cheeks had
become flushed a vivid freight-car
color. It was with great relief that I
finally saw her peer into the freezer,
remove the dasher, and proceed to
seal up her confection and cover it with
newspapers and an astrakhan cape.</p>

<p>The precise moment when a water-ice
becomes simple is when it is
smoothly slipped into a long-stemmed
sherbet glass. Our guests, we think,
enjoyed our simple meal. But after
they had gone, the word which exactly
described our state of mind was not the
word nonchalant.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>&ldquo;Barbara!&rdquo; said Margaret energetically,
&ldquo;for supper, let's open a box of
blueberries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did. Blueberries really <em>are</em> simple.
We made our evening meal of them,
accompanied by a few left-over popover
skins.</p>

<p>Margaret and I still feel that we
could deal somewhat hopefully with a
leaking pipe. We still think that our
calamities were a little out of the
ordinary. But we do not wonder quite
so much now that Mother does not
wholly appreciate her dinner when she
has guests, that she does not oftener
make simple frozen desserts, or that
she stays in such close company with
her wheels when they are on their way
around.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>THE WILL TO BOSS</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/cap-t.png" width="142" height="144" alt=""/></div>

<p class="drop-cap drop-t"><span class="upper-case">There</span> are people who
have a right to boss;&mdash;parents,
for instance,
and generals in the army.
With these we are not concerned. But
most of us, not officially in authority,
now and then have ideas of our own
that we are willing to pass on. Some
of us have them more than others.</p>

<p>The typical boss is usually a capable
executive with a great unselfish imagination
and the gift of speech. He usually
knows enough to curb himself in public;
it is only in the home that his tendencies
run riot. In a family where all the
brothers and sisters belong to this type,
you can run riot only to a certain
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>
extent. If you go too far, you meet
somebody else also running riot, and
collisions ensue.</p>

<p>If you are an elder sister, for instance,
with a tendency toward what your
younger brothers call &ldquo;getting bossy,&rdquo;
you find yourself constantly having
vivid mental pictures of the best way
to do a given thing. With these fancy-pictures
in mind, it is hard for you to
believe that your companions have any
ideas at all. As you look at another
person from the outside, you find it
hard to believe that his head is working.
If our heads were only made like these
ovens with glass in the door, so that
you could watch the half-baked thinking
rise and fall&mdash;but no. Your
brother sitting carelessly on the veranda
may have his mind on the time;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75"> </a>
he may be planning just how he will
presently rush to his room, bathe and
change, snatch his hat, run to the
station, and connect with the train on
daylight-saving time. He may be thinking
hard about all this, but he does not
look as if he were. You fidget while the
minutes go by, and then you go to the
window and speak. If your spirit has
been broken by much browbeating for
past attempts to give advice, you
speak timidly. If you are of stouter
stuff, you speak roughly to your little
boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; you say (timidly or roughly
as the case may be)&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose you
know what time it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Tom.</p>

<p>That ought to end it. But if you are
a true boss, you go on. You know that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" title="76"> </a>
you are being irritating. You know
that Tom is of age. But you are willing,
like all great prophets, to risk unpopularity
for the sake of your Message.
The spirit of the crier in the wilderness
is upon you, and you keep at it until
one of two things happens. If Tom is
in a good temper, he goes upstairs to
humor you, with a condescending tread
and a tired sigh. If he is fractious, he
argues: Did you ever know him to
miss a train? Did you ever hear of his
forgetting an appointment? How do
you suppose he ever manages to get to
places when you are away from home?</p>

<p>My brother Geoffrey, in his day, has
been a great sufferer from this kind of
thing. As memory reviews his youth,
there stands out only one occasion when
he really achieved anything like freedom
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77"> </a>
from sisterly counsel. This was
when he picked the pears. The pears
on six large loaded trees were ready to
harvest. Geoffrey said that he was
willing to pick, but not to pick to order.
We would have to engage to let him
pick the pears in his own way. We
promised, though we knew too well our
brother's way of picking pears. He
holds quite a little reception from the
tree-tops, entertaining passers-by with
delightful repartee, and giving everybody
a pear. As time goes on, he gets
to throwing pears. &ldquo;Somebody will
get hurt,&rdquo; said our mother anxiously.
But a contract is a contract, and we
tried not to look out of the window.
In this unaccustomed air of freedom,
Geoffrey's spirits rose and rose. High
in the branches, taking his time, he grew
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" title="78"> </a>
more and more abandoned. He had
just reached the very top of the tallest
tree when he saw far up the street the
form of the ugliest and largest dog who
ever visited our town, a strange white
creature named Joe&mdash;a dog hard to
define, but resembling one's childhood
idea of the blood-hound type. Every
one spoke of this dog as &ldquo;Joseph A.
Graham&rdquo;: &ldquo;Joe&rdquo; seemed too simple
a name to be in scale with his size and
ferocity. Down the street he came,
loafing along. Geoffrey, ordinarily kind
to pets, selected a large mellow pear,
aimed it with steady eye, and hit
Joseph A. Graham, accurately, amidships.
Joseph flew up into the air,
landed on a slant, gathered his large
feet together for a plunge, and came
dashing down the street with murder
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>
in his great red eye. At that moment
Geoffrey looked down and saw with
horror that an elderly gentleman was
just coming up the street. It was
obvious that Joseph thought that the
old gentleman threw the pear. Geoffrey,
emitting hoarse cries of warning,
came swarming down the tree to the
rescue, swinging from branch to branch
like an orang-outang. The elderly gentleman,
grasping the situation in the
nick of time, stepped neatly inside our
screen door, and Joseph, thwarted of
reprisal, snuffed around the steps, muttered
to himself for a few moments, and
then went shuffling on down the street.
Geoffrey, still ardently apologizing to
the passer-by, went back to his tree-top
to recover from this, the only troubled
moment in that influential day.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a>By clever bargaining, you can occasionally
buy off your natural advisers
in this way, and enjoy perfect independence.
But there are projects that really
call for a good boss. When a number
of people are at work together, the
trained worker should direct the group.
Even in your family, you are allowed
to be an autocrat in things that are
your specialty. But you are supposed
to be pleasant about it. This is not so
easy when you are in the full heat of
action. When you have your mind on
a difficult project, your commands to
your helpers are apt to sound curt. You
are likely to talk to them as if they were
beneath you. The unskilled helper in
an affair demanding skill gives the impression
of belonging to an inferior
class&mdash;something a little below the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>
social status of a coolie. He even feels
inferior, and is therefore touchy. If
you order him too gruffly, he is likely to
take offence and knock off for the day.</p>

<p>Barbara, for instance, once very
nearly lost a valued slave when I was
giving her my awkward assistance about
the camera. She had decided to take a
picture of Israel Putnam's Wolf-Den
from a spot where no camera-tripod
had ever been pitched before. The
Wolf-Den sits on a slant above a cliff
in the deep woods. At one side of it
there is a capital place from which to
take its picture, a level spot on which
a tripod will stand securely. From this
point most of the pictures hitherto
taken of the Den were snapped. But
Barbara was resolved to get a full
front view to show the lettering on a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>
bronze tablet that had recently been
placed on the Den. She wanted a time
exposure, and she said that she was
going to need assistance. Her idea was
to stand on a jutting rock just at the
edge of the cliff and hold the camera in
the desired position while the rest of the
party adjusted the legs of the tripod
beneath it.</p>

<p>Every one who has ever set up a tripod
knows that its loosely hinged legs
can be elongated or telescoped by a
system of slides and screws. In order
to arrange our tripod with all its three
pods on the uneven ground, we found
that we must shorten one leg to its
extreme shortness, and lengthen the
second leg to its maximum length. This
left the third leg out in the air over the
brink of the precipice. Our guest was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>
to manage the short leg, our mother
was to manage the important and
strategic leg among the rocks, and I
offered to build a combination of bridge
and flying buttress out from the slope
of the cliff, for the third.</p>

<p>We started our project with that
cordial fellow-feeling that rises from
a common faith in a visionary enterprise,
and I am sure that we could have
kept that beautiful spirit to the end if
it had not been for the mosquitoes.
There are no wolves at the Wolf-Den
now, but on a muggy day the mosquitoes
are just as hungry. They rise all
around in insubstantial drifts, never
seeming to alight, yet stinging in
clusters. A true Wolf-Den mosquito
can land, bite, and make good his escape
before you have finished brushing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84"> </a>
him out of your eyes. You cannot
brush insects out of your eyes, slap the
back of your neck, and take a picture
at the same time. Barbara, both hands
busy holding the camera, was desperately
kicking the ankle of one foot with
the toe of the other. I counted fifteen
mosquitoes sitting unmoved around the
rims of her low shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't take too much pains with
that bridge,&rdquo; said she to me in considerate
company tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I respectfully, &ldquo;but I
have to build it up high enough to meet
the leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, hurry,&rdquo; said she, still
kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I evenly, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When two sisters discourse like this
before a guest, there creeps into their
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>
voices a note of preternatural sweetness,
a restraint and simplicity of utterance
that speak volumes to the trained
ear.</p>

<p>I was hurrying all I could, but for
my unnatural bridge I had not the materials
I could have wished. I found a
weathered wooden fence-rail, balanced
one end of it on the cliff and the other
end in the crotch of a big tree that
leaned over the side hill; but this bridge
had to be built up with a pile of sand,
leaves, small stones, and stubble balanced
carefully upon it. Meanwhile,
my mother was busily drilling a hole
in the rock to make a firm emplacement
at a distance for leg number
two.</p>

<p>Finally our three positions were approximately
correct, and the more delicate
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>
process of adjustment began.
Barbara, from under her dark cloth,
gave muffled directions. We obeyed,
shifting, screwing, unscrewing, adjusting.
Our guest was still cheery. Success
hovered before us in plain sight.
So did the mosquitoes. Barbara's directions
began to sound tense. They
sounded especially tense when she spoke
to me. I was balancing precariously
part-way down the shale cliff, digging
in my heels and doing the best I could
with the materials at hand. Looking
timidly up at my sister's black-draped,
mosquito studded figure, I had been first
conciliatory, then surly, then sullen.
Barbara had now begun to focus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lower!&rdquo; said Barbara between her
teeth.</p>

<p>Obediently we all three lowered.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>&ldquo;No, no, not you!&rdquo; said Barbara to
me. &ldquo;Yours was too low already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are moments in this life when
the presence of a guest is an impediment
to free speech. Barbara, as anybody
can see, had the advantage. She
was the commanding officer. Any response
from me would have been a retort
from the ranks. Since one of her other
two helpers was her mother and the
other a guest, her words to them had
to be sugared. In a sugar-shortage, it
is the lower classes who suffer. By this
time one could easily distinguish her
directions to me by their truculent tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make the bridge a trifle higher,&rdquo;
said she curtly.</p>

<p>I obediently brought another grain
of sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Higher!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>I silently added five smooth stones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, build it up!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;You
ought to see the slant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pried a large boulder from the
ledge and balanced it on the rail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your rail's breaking!&rdquo; cried my
mother, so suddenly that I lost my
footing.</p>

<p>I seized the leg of the tripod in one
hand, the branch of a tree with the
other, while the flying buttress went
rumbling down the defile, and I was
left clinging to the bare rock, that refuge
of the wild goat.</p>

<p>We have now some very attractive
pictures of the Den, taken from a spot
where no tripod was ever pitched before,
and where I hope no tripod will be
pitched again. But as we developed
the plates that night, I told Barbara
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>
that I did not think that I was qualified
to help her much about the camera any
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were all right,&rdquo; said she kindly.
&ldquo;It was the mosquitoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I was mollified by this as perhaps
I could have been by no logic in
the world.</p>

<p>The right to boss is conceded to the
expert. It is also sometimes extended
to members of the family who are for
the time being in the centre of the
stage. At such times you are permitted
to dictate&mdash;when you are to have a
guest, for instance, or when you are
about to be married. For a day or two
before the wedding, your wish is law.
You really need to stay on hand until
the last minute, however, to enforce the
letter of the law to the end. Otherwise,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>
circumstances may get ahead of you.</p>

<p>Geoffrey, for example, directly after
announcing his engagement to our best
friend Priscilla Sherwood, enjoyed a
time of perfect power. He knew that
he needed only to say, &ldquo;Priscilla likes
so and so,&rdquo; and so and so would follow.
Barbara and I reminded him that we
knew Priscilla better than he did, but we
could not say that we were engaged to
her. Just before the wedding, Geoffrey
took us aside to explain seriously about
his plans, and to give us our orders for
the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don't want you to throw anything,&rdquo;
said Geoffrey reasonably. &ldquo;No
rice or confetti or shoes. And you
needn't even see us to the train. Priscilla
doesn't care about any demonstration,
and I think it would be just
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>
as well to go off quietly. We'd just as
soon the other people on the train
didn't know we were a bride and
groom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara and I, struck with the originality
of this point of view, promised
to throw nothing. Priscilla, meanwhile,
reasoned equally well with her brothers.
After the wedding, we all stood cordially
on the curbstone and let them
drive off to the train. Then, deserted,
the two families confronted each other
rather blankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn't seem as if they had
actually gone, does it?&rdquo; said Barbara
uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They wouldn't mind if we waved
to them when the train goes out, would
they?&rdquo; began one of the Sherwoods
tentatively.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>Barbara was inspired. &ldquo;Come on
down to our house,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and
then they can see us from the train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the advantages of a home
near the railway is the fact that you
can see your friends off on trips without
leaving your dooryard. Each man for
himself, we went streaming down the
last hill, fearing at any minute to hear
the train pull out. To our dismay, we
saw that a long freight-train was standing
on the siding in such a position as
to cut off our view of the express.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you are on the train,&rdquo; I
panted as I ran, &ldquo;you can see our upstairs
windows even when freight-cars
are in the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'll wave out of the front windows,&rdquo;
said Barbara, and we all rushed
upstairs.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>&ldquo;They'll never think to look up here,
will they?&rdquo; said one of the brothers
Sherwood anxiously as we peered out
along the vista of track. &ldquo;The pear
trees are in the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might just step outside the
window,&rdquo; said Barbara resourcefully.
&ldquo;The piazza roof is perfectly safe.
Then they couldn't help seeing us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wrapping our best clothes about us,
we crept out through the window one
by one, and went cautiously along the
tin roof to a vantage-point beyond the
pear trees. When a company of grown
people goes walking on a tin roof, there
are moments of shock when the tin
bubbles snap and crackle, making a
sound nothing short of terrifying, like
the reverberations of season-cracks in
the ice on a pond. We ranged ourselves
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>
in a row near the eaves-pipe, just in
time. The train went hooting by. They
saw us. We waved the wedding flowers,
and they waved back. We saw them
laughing. We waved until the end of
the train disappeared around the curve.
And as we assisted each other politely
one by one through the window again,
we had a comfortable sensation of having
wound up the affair with a finish
and completeness that had been lacking
after the first farewell.</p>

<p>Still feeling a little uplifted with
excitement, we went up the street to
report events to our grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean to say that you went up
on to the <em>roof</em> to wave?&rdquo; said our
grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Barbara thoughtfully,
&ldquo;it didn't seem quite like going up
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>
on the roof at the time. It all happened
so gradually. We just stepped
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they saw you?&rdquo; inquired
Grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Nobody could help it.
Everybody saw us.&rdquo; Barbara glowed
reminiscently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you waved the wedding flowers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Barbara happily. &ldquo;Father
Sherwood gave us each an armful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said our grandmother, resuming
her sewing, &ldquo;I shouldn't wonder
if the other passengers on that train
thought that something had happened
to Geoffrey.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>To govern one's own kinsmen successfully,
one certainly does need to be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" title="96"> </a>
on the spot. One cannot afford to leave
them for an instant. One should be
alert and watchful, and as diplomatic
as circumstances will allow. The ability
to boss implies a ready understanding
and the knack of seeing the end from
the beginning. It implies also a hardy
constitution and the gift of tongues.
But after all, in the last analysis, it is
largely a matter of the Will.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" title="97"> </a>MORE TO IT THAN YOU'D THINK</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/cap-i.png" width="149" height="151" alt=""/></div>

<p class="drop-cap drop-i1"><span class="upper-case">I am</span> often reminded of a
lady, who, during the war,
volunteered to oversee all
the Canteen work for
soldiers passing through our town. Her
favorite phrase, accompanied by a
surprised accent, became the following
one: &ldquo;There's more <em>to</em> this job than
you'd think from the outside looking
in.&rdquo; Then she would proceed with
many astounding details: soldiers who
required two cups of coffee, or three
lumps of sugar, milk that in the course
of time became dubious, and trains
that in the course of time became
late.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>I sympathized with this lady and
helped her wash the dishes. And I
have never questioned her statement.
Moreover, I have yet to find the job
to which this statement does not apply.
I suppose that, until you become a
postal clerk, you know very little
about the intricacies into which a
capital &ldquo;S&rdquo; may go, or how the rats
eat the stamps. A job is always annotated
for the employee.</p>

<p>Certainly, teaching school introduces
you to manifold works which could not
be anticipated by looking in. In fact,
when my friendly janitor once said that
it must be very easy to teach the First
Grade, I caught myself falling back on
the popular phrase with some emotion&mdash;&ldquo;There's
more to it than you'd
think.&rdquo; My most baffling problems
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99"> </a>
were just a little too complex to mention
to my janitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What instantly comes to your
mind,&rdquo; says my college friend who is
&ldquo;taking&rdquo; Psychology, &ldquo;when I say
the word &lsquo;ping-pong&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tell him. By right of which I
retaliate, &ldquo;What instantly comes to
your mind when I say the word &lsquo;sand-table&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, little paper pine trees,&rdquo; responds
the student (who is also
&ldquo;taking&rdquo; Education),&mdash;&ldquo;and wigwams
and canoes, and a real piece of glass for
a pond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this comes to my mind, too,&mdash;with
addenda. The addenda, however,
come to my mind first: Spilling Sand,
Sweeping up Sand, Trailing your fingers
in Sand as you march past, and, if
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" title="100"> </a>
you are <em>very</em> newly five years old,
Throwing Sand. This is not because I
am soured on the sand-table. I have
merely learned that there is more <em>to</em> one
than you would suspect from the outside
of one, looking in. Sand-tables may
mean pine trees, and they may mean
pandemonium.</p>

<p>Throw several such freighted words
into a mixed group, and the reactions
are passionately interesting. If you
say, &ldquo;Muscular movement,&rdquo; &ldquo;Interest
and Attention,&rdquo; &ldquo;Socialized Classes,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Projects,&rdquo; you can sift out the
school-teachers by their smile.</p>

<p>In fact, there is a very large group of
noun substantives which mark, for an
Elementary teacher, at least, the seasons
of the year. Usually she has a top
drawer full of these. Many a teacher
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101"> </a>
longs for the horse-chestnut-on-a-string
season to appear, if only to finish up the
season of the maple-key;&mdash;that large
pale-green maple-key, which, by clever
splitting of the central seed, may be
made to stay on one's nose. My young
friend Junior O'Brien once read to me
&ldquo;The Three Billy Goats Gruff,&rdquo; with
a maple-key over each ear, one on his
freckled nose, and two on his apple
cheeks. I gave over my reading-lesson
period to researches as to how his hard
little cheeks could yield enough slack
to accommodate a key; and before I
was ready to ask Junior to remove his
decorations, the force of gravity intervened.</p>

<p>The maple-key, I suppose, suggests
eye-glasses. Certainly a bit of wire,
twisted into spectacles, follows keys.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>
These may be very ornate in the upper
grades, more nearly approaching the
lorgnette, or even the opera-glass. It is
a fascinating thing to see what a wire
hairpin correctly treated will do to
a young face. It lightens my day's
load, this vision of grave childish eyes
through the twisted rims, and that
magnificent effort of will, contrary to
nature, to obtain perfect immobility of
the nose.</p>

<p>In company with the gross of wire
spectacles in my drawer are numerous
&ldquo;snapping-bugs.&rdquo; These may be
bought for one cent each, in the snapping-bug
season, of the ice-cream man.
They are double bugs of tin, which, if
pinched in the proper spot, will yield
a sharp click reminiscent of the old-fashioned
stereopticon lecture. Snapping-bugs
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>
may go far in &ldquo;socializing&rdquo;
a First Grade, and in making friends
with a newcomer at recess, but when
they snap in school they give me an
uneasy sense that my audience is in
haste to have the picture changed. So
I have six snapping-bugs.</p>

<p>I have five tumble-bugs. These are
vivid green or purple gelatin capsules
about an inch long, each housing a lead
ball. Place the bug on an inclined plane,
and it will promptly turn right side up,
or the other side up, as long as the plane
continues to incline. Since tumble-bugs
are practically noiseless, their life is
somewhat longer than that of their
snapping cousins.</p>

<p>I have one sling-shot. It might be
argued that First Graders are too
young for sling-shots. So they are.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>
They all too often receive their own
charge full in the eye. They much
prefer their comfortable acorn pipes.
These are pandemic in October, as are
also balloons.</p>

<p>I once perceived Dominick, in the
height of the balloon season, with a
frankfurter balloon, a shape then new.
The active part was at just that moment
inert&mdash;a dried and crumpled
wisp of rubber. But its tube was unmistakably
going to be blown. Dominick
will never know how much his
teacher wished to see his balloon, properly
inflated, swaying and glowing as
only a green sausage balloon can glow.
I was deterred by a misgiving as to
whether this type of balloon collapsed
quietly after its magnificent spectacle,
or whether it was of that variety which
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105"> </a>
emits a peculiar penetrating whistle
as it shrinks&mdash;an unmistakable sound,
due to be placed accurately in her list of
sounds by my teacher-friend next door,
who does not approve of balloons in
academic session. Dominick, however,
wished more than I did to see his
lighter-than-air craft in all its glory.
I finally deposited it among the false
noses and horse-chestnuts in my drawer.</p>

<p>I used to wonder why a teacher
<em>wanted</em> marbles and walnuts, and pencil-sharpeners
shaped like a rabbit.
She doesn't. She simply does not want
to hear them dropping, dropping, ever
dropping, like the pennies in Sabbath
School. There is something thrilling to
<em>any</em>body about a real agate. If it is
about, you have to look at it. It is so
perfectly round. Anything perfectly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" title="106"> </a>
round, or perfectly cylindrical, likes,
as we learn in Kindergarten, to roll. It
likes, upon occasion, to &ldquo;rest&rdquo;; but it
does not like this nearly as well. It is
not fair to a child to let him spend his
time playing with an agate in school.
Neither is it fair to him to destroy the
beauty of an agate for him&mdash;the charm
of its shape, or the marvel of its construction.
A teacher should strike a
medium so delicately and absolutely
medium that the angels themselves
pause lest they jar the weights.</p>

<p>But the most curious phenomenon
which I have observed, one which
could not possibly be anticipated by an
outsider looking in, is the effect of my
setting the clock. There are times when
a perfectly innocent shuffling of thirty-four
feet in the First Grade assumes
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" title="107"> </a>
proportions far more important than
Murder in the First Degree. Then it is
that I set the clock. If it does not need
setting, I set it forward first, and then
back again. The clock is high on the
wall, reached by the janitor (all too
seldom) from a very high step-ladder.
I set it from the floor. I take the yardstick
and advance on the clock. It is
a nice operation to push up the glass
crystal with a pliant stick, haul down
the minute-hand, and finally to close
the door. The door must first be
lifted into its proper position, and
then hammered shut. Each bang of
the yardstick sounds as if it would be
followed certainly by showers of broken
glass. I think that this uncertainty is
what keeps my pupils' hearts fluttering
and their feet still. Deathly silence always
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>
accompanies my setting of the
clock. An imperceptible sound of relief,
like a group-sigh, follows the click of the
door in its catch. I can tiptoe back, on
that sigh, to quiet industry.</p>

<p>It is true that children, with the best
intentions, sometimes bring inappropriate
busy-work to school. But teaching
them has not dowered me with
any disdain for my students. They are
beneath me only in years. In fact, I
raise my hat to some of them in spirit,
as I teach them to raise theirs to me in
truth. Here and there I calmly recognize
a superior. I am constantly taking
care that no youthful James Watt can
say to me in later years, &ldquo;You put out
my first tea-kettle which boiled in
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suppose that Pauline will eventually
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>
be a gracious hostess, saying just
the right thing to her guests and to her
husband&mdash;charming every masculine
acquaintance on sight. Even now, I
find that she is engaged, provisionally,
to James Henry Davis. Perhaps some
day Adamoskow, with his long clever
fingers and his dreamy eyes, and no
head whatever for &ldquo;number,&rdquo; will be
charging me five dollars a seat to hear
him play. His impresario can count the
change for him.</p>

<p>And I know that James Henry Davis,
at seventeen, will have the power to
break hearts to the right of him, and
hearts to the left of him, with the same
dimple, the same wonderful pompadour,
and the same lifted eyebrow that
he now uses for the same purpose in
Grade I. I know that he will out-dance
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>
his dancing-master at his Junior Prom.
I shall wonder, when I see him in his
white gloves, how I ever dared to take
his acorn pipe away. Therefore I take
it away as innocuously as possible, and
touch his soft pompadour, in passing,
with a reverent hand.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>TRIO IMPETUOSO</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/cap-t.png" width="142" height="144" alt=""/></div>

<p class="drop-cap drop-t"><span class="upper-case">The</span> first steps of certain
things are beautiful; the
first flush of buds along a
maple branch, for instance,
or the first smooth launching of an
Indian canoe. But the first steps of
music are commonly not so. The first
note of a young robin is a squawk.
The first piercing note of a young violinist
is not in tune with the music of
any sphere.</p>

<p>Musicians learn to expect a certain
amount of wear and tear in first attempts.
Even the professional orchestra
makes bad work of a new symphony
the first time through. And in an amateur
orchestra, where the players are of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>
various grades of proficiency, the playing
of a new piece of music is a hazardous
affair.</p>

<p>In our own orchestra, when we read
a new piece of music for the first time,
we usually decide to &ldquo;try it once
through without stopping.&rdquo; Come what
will, we will meet it together. The
great thing is to keep going. Sometimes
we emerge from this enterprise
with all bows flying and everybody
triumphantly prolonging the same last
note. At other times we come out at
the finish one by one, each man for
himself, like the singers in an old-fashioned
round-song rendering of
&ldquo;Three Blind Mice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To enjoy playing in an orchestra like
ours, the musician should have a great
soul and a rugged nervous system. He
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>
should not be too proud to play his best
on music that is too easy for him, and
he should not be afraid to try music
that is too hard. Music within the easy
reach of every member of an amateur
orchestra is scarce. The first time
through, there is usually somebody
who has to skirmish anxiously along,
experimenting softly to himself when
he loses his place, and coming out
strong when he finds it again. From
among the many desirable notes in a
rapid passage, he chooses as many as
he can hit in the time allowed, playing
selected grace-notes here and there,
and skipping the rest. We cannot all
have everything.</p>

<p>Most amateurs call this process
&ldquo;vamping the part.&rdquo; This, and the
clever deed known as &ldquo;cueing in&rdquo; passages
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>
supposed to be played by instruments
that we lack, are our chief offences
against the law.</p>

<p>There are proud spirits in the world
who refuse to have anything to do with
either of these sins. When they come
to a passage that is not well within
their reach, they lay down the fiddle
and the bow, and sit back tolerantly
while the rest go on without them.
Their motto is the one made famous by
a certain publishing house: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout bien
ou rien.</i> That is a fine watchword for a
publisher, but fatal in a scrub orchestra.
There, it is likely to mean that
&ldquo;tout&rdquo; must go &ldquo;bien,&rdquo; or you resign.</p>

<p>Nobody has ever resigned from our
orchestra. We are called a Trio, because
our minimum is three. But, in
actual fact, we rarely play with less
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>
than seven performers. Whenever we
are about to play in public, we reënforce
ourselves with additional instruments,
beginning with a favorite extra
violin. If we are to play in the evening,
we can count on a viola and a clarinet,
played respectively by the senior and
the junior partner of a hardware firm:
Mr. Bronson and Mr. Billings, of Bronson
and Billings. If we are to play on
Sunday, we are sure of a double-bass.
And on state occasions, we are joined
by an attorney-at-law who plays the
piccolo. People who invite us to play
always request music by Our Trio, and
then inquire delicately how many of us
there will be.</p>

<p>A trio of this kind is sure to be in
demand. In making our way to the
place where we are to play, we have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>
learned to go in relays through the
streets. This is not because we are
ashamed to be seen carrying the badge
of our talent through the town, but
because if we all go together there is a
discussion about who shall carry what
instruments. Barbara, our 'cellist, is
the storm-centre of these broils. The
'cello, like some people, has the misfortune
to look a great deal heavier than
it really is. No gentleman likes to let
a lady carry one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, it's as light as a feather,&rdquo;
says Barbara, swinging it easily alongside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; reasons the viola earnestly,
&ldquo;think how it looks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To avoid all friction, Barbara goes
ahead with the gentleman who plays
the bass-viol. Together they present
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>
a striking aspect to the passer-by, but
they have peace and mutual understanding
in their hearts. Nobody could
expect a gentleman, however gallant,
to carry both a 'cello and a double-bass.</p>

<p>The rest of us follow along at a safe
distance, and arrive at becoming intervals
at the place where we are to play.</p>

<p>For convenience in talking among
ourselves, we have divided our performances
into three classes: the platform
performance, the semi-screened,
and the screened. Our semi-screened
programmes are those where we are
partly hidden from view, in choir-lofts,
conservatories, verandas, and anterooms.
The screened are those that
take place behind palms. Of all these
sorts, we vastly prefer the screened.</p>

<p>Each of us has a special reason for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>
this preference. Mr. Bronson, the viola,
prefers it because, screened, he is
allowed to beat time with his foot.
There is something very contented-looking
about the tilt of his long shoe,
thrust out informally amidst the shrubbery&mdash;the
toe rising and falling in
exact rhythm with the music, now
legato, now appassionato, our perfect
metronome. Such happiness is contagious.</p>

<p>Barbara likes to be screened because
then she can dig a tiny hole in the floor
for the end-pin of the 'cello, and stick
the pin into it once for all, while she
plays. The vogue of the waxed hardwood
floor is a great trial to 'cellists.
It is upsetting to feel your great
instrument skidding out from under
you suddenly, with a jerk that you can
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119"> </a>
neither foresee nor control. When we
go to places where the device of boring
a hole in the floor may not be well
received, Barbara takes along a neat
strip of stair-carpet, anchors it at one
end with her chair and at the other with
her music-stand, and sits on it firmly,
much as the ancient Roman used to
camp upon a square of tessellated
pavement brought with him from
Rome.</p>

<p>Mr. Billings, the clarinet, likes the
screened performance because his wife
has told him that he has a mannerism
of arching his eyebrows when he plays.
In playing a wind-instrument, the eyebrows
are a great help. He can arch
them all he likes, behind the palms.</p>

<p>The rest of us enjoy the sense of
cosy safety that comes when we arrange
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" title="120"> </a>
our racks, distribute the parts, and
settle down with our backs to the
foliage for an evening of music, out of
sight. We can play old favorites, far
too tattered to appear on a printed
programme; new things not sufficiently
rehearsed; extracts from compositions
that we cannot play beyond a certain
point; and, best of all, those beloved
collections of what Mr. Robert Haven
Schauffler used to call &ldquo;derangements.&rdquo;
All these things, barred by the platform
artist, we play blissfully, behind the
potted plants.</p>

<p>Since everybody outside our leafy
covert is talking, we are free, not only
from criticism, but also from the
obligation of acknowledging applause.
All the little niceties of platform procedure&mdash;bowings,
exits, dealing with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" title="121"> </a>
encores&mdash;are out of the question.
Since we play continuously, there is no
chance for encores.</p>

<p>There has been one exception to this
rule. One night at a Saint Patrick's
Day banquet, Our Trio was out in full
force. Even the piccolo was with us.
Our corner was carefully walled in with
heavy burlap screens, because this was
a business-men's supper, and no ladies
were supposed to be present. We had
brought along a sheaf of Irish music in
honor of the day, and we played it unexpectedly
after a series of other things.
As we finished one of the appealing
Irish airs, the applause broke out all
over the hall in a genuine encore. We
listened, electrified, laying an ear to the
cracks. Barbara, who thinks that we
are altogether too easily set up by the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" title="122"> </a>
plaudits of the crowd, stood up, 'cello
at an angle, and made a series of elaborate
bows for our benefit behind the
screen. The viola sprang to his feet and
joined her, and they were bowing and
scraping hand in hand like Farrar and
Caruso, when the front screen was
thrown suddenly wide open by the
toastmaster who had been sent to request
an encore, and no less than forty
gentlemen looked in. Since that time,
we have not felt too sheltered, even
with burlap screens.</p>

<p>The question of applause, so nearly
negligible in the screened performance,
is a matter of the greatest moment on
the platform. The process of responding
to it is complicated by numbers. A
solo artist can step in easily, bow, and
step out again. But it takes too long
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" title="123"> </a>
for a trio of eight or more to step in,
bow, and step out. We have to wait
behind the scenes for a real encore.</p>

<p>We are highly gratified at a chance
to play our encores, of which we carry
a supply. The only hitch is the little
matter of deciding just what an encore
is. The viola thinks that an encore consists
of applause going in waves&mdash;starting
to die out and reviving again
in gusts of hearty clapping. Two such
gusts, he says, should comprise an encore.
But our pianist thinks that we
should wait until the clapping stops
entirely, and that, if it then bursts out
afresh, it shall be esteemed an encore.</p>

<p>One evening the encore was by every
standard unmistakable. Our mother
was at the piano that night, and, supposing
that we were ready, led the way
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" title="124"> </a>
in. The rest of us, absorbed in giving
out the parts of the music, did not see
her go. We waited, wondering where
she was. Tempests of amused applause
meanwhile surged up around our lonely
accompanist stranded in the hall. We
heard the thundering, and scattered in
frantic search. One of us could have
played the piano part, but the music
for that had disappeared as well as the
musician. The double-bass chanced
upon the janitor's little boy in the corridor,
and asked him if he knew where
our accompanist could be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes! Can't you hear 'em
clap?&rdquo; said the boy in surprise. &ldquo;She's
went in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have heard that there are sensitive
people who are jarred upon by applause,
people who hold the perfect-tribute
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" title="125"> </a>
theory: they think that the
audience, out of respect to the artist,
ought to remain reverently silent after
each number. I cannot answer for the
great artist, but I know that our trio
does not feel that way about it. We
like applause. Silence is a mysterious
thing. From behind the stage how are
you to tell a reverent hush from a
shocked one? The trained ear can instantly
classify applause; but silence,
however reverent, does not carry well
behind the scenes. We like a little
something after each number to cheer
us on.</p>

<p>We do know, however, that in a
small private audience there is a sense
of strain if the listeners feel obliged to
make a demonstration after each selection.
Clapping seems affected in a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_126" title="126"> </a>
group of three or four, and the business
of thinking up well-selected remarks is
a serious matter. Knowing this, we always
relieve our drawing-room audiences
of embarrassment by making the
remarks ourselves. The moment the
last lingering whisper has completely
died away from the strings, we turn as
one man and begin to compliment the
music. &ldquo;We like that ending better
than any other part of the whole thing,&rdquo;
we say appreciatively. This lifts a load
of anxiety from the minds of our hearers,
and serves to break the hush.</p>

<p>The question of playing to guests in
our own home is the subject on which
our family <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensemble</i> most nearly came to
mutiny. Our father had a way, contrary
to orders, of suggesting a little
music when we had visitors. The rest
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" title="127"> </a>
of us objected to this, especially if the
guests were people who did not play.
Once, when an evening of hospitality
to strangers was in store, our mother
was giving us all our final instructions.
She turned to our father last of all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Endicott,&rdquo; she began impressively,
&ldquo;this evening you mustn't say the
word &lsquo;music&rsquo; unless somebody else suggests
it. If they want us to play, they
will ask us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our father, a little grieved to think
that any one should worry lest he do so
strange a thing, promised to comply.</p>

<p>But that evening, finding the guests
more and more congenial in the midst
of firelight conversation, he turned to
them cordially and said, &ldquo;I know that
this is just the time when you would
enjoy a little music, but I have been
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" title="128"> </a>
told that I must not say the word unless
you suggest it first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guests, highly diverted, rose to
the occasion and begged prettily. They
said that they had been starving for
some music all along. When visitors
who do not really care for music have
once been launched on the process of
asking for it, the kindest thing to do is
to play promptly something brief and
sweet and trailing&mdash;some <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Abendlied</i> or
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Albumblatt</i>, for instance, and have it
over. In the presence of guests, such
family crises must be tided over with
neat persiflage. It was only after the
company had gone that the mutiny
took place.</p>

<p>But there is one kind of audience
that we like the best of all. Sometimes
of an early summer evening, when our
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" title="129"> </a>
whole orchestra has gathered to rehearse
for a performance that we have
in store, the relatives and friends of the
players ask to be allowed to come and
listen. We arrange the hammock and
steamer-chairs in a screened corner
outside the house, and there our listeners&mdash;perhaps
the sister of the bass-viol,
the business partner of the piccolo, and
a neighbor or two&mdash;settle themselves
comfortably under the windows. Then
we play, interrupted only by an occasional
shout from outside, when somebody
requests an encore, or asks what
that last thing was. Our steamer-chair
audience has often begged us to announce
the composer and the name of
each selection as we go along, and we
usually appoint somebody to do this,
megaphoning the titles through the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" title="130"> </a>
window. But before we have gone very
far, we forget our audience. They lie
there neglected, scattered on the lawn.
The dew falls around them, the shadows
gather over them, and they give up
the attempt to attract our notice. We
are rehearsing now, not performing,
and our blood is up.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have a strong-minded
guest who refuses to be treated in this
way. He declines the steamer-chair,
with steamer-rug and cushion, preferring
to sit against the wall in a cramped
corner of the room where we are playing.
We assure him that the music
sounds better from a distance, but he
begs to be allowed to stay. He says
that he likes to watch as well as listen.
This does not disturb us; we are rather
flattered if the truth were known. In
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" title="131"> </a>
fact, we know a little how he feels. There
is a dramatic and pictorial value in the
humblest orchestra, no matter how
densely you populate your music-room.
Usually the guest who enjoys this sight
is a person who would like to play if he
knew how&mdash;one who can join in the
excitement when things are going well.</p>

<p>Like all amateurs, we do become excited.
And when we are excited, we
tend to play faster and faster, and
louder and louder, unless something
holds us up. &ldquo;Pianissimo!&rdquo; shouts the
double-bass, fortissimo. Thus exhorted,
we settle down just as earnestly, but
with more attention to the waymarks
and the phrasings of the score.</p>

<p>Probably it is at these moments that
we do our very best. The bass-viol
standing by the fireplace, his genial face
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" title="132"> </a>
unsmiling now, intent, takes the rich
low harmony with great sweeps of his
practised bow. Barbara, over against
the music-cabinet, plays smoothly on,
her dark old 'cello planted firmly, the
shadow of her hair across its great
brown pegs. Mr. Billings, with pointed
eyebrows arching steeply, pipes and
carols above us like a lark. And
through it all the vibrant foot of Mr.
Bronson faithfully beats time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you get together and
play like this often?&rdquo; inquires the sister
of the bass-viol, when the audience at
last, with arms full of steamer-rugs and
cushions, comes trailing in.</p>

<p>The piccolo, passing sandwiches,
looks up with hearty response. &ldquo;Yes,
why can't we?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;After the
reception, let's try to keep it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" title="133"> </a>The rest of us, fastening the covers
around our instruments, give enthusiastic
consent. &ldquo;Every other Monday,
let's meet without fail,&rdquo; we say. But
in our hearts we know that we shall not.
We shall all be busy&mdash;all sorts of
things will happen to prevent&mdash;and
the weeks will fly. Yet we know that
sooner or later our trio will meet
again&mdash;probably for a desperate rehearsal
some months hence, just in time
for the next event where we are asked
to play.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" title="134"> </a>THE RETURN OF A, B, C</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/cap-t.png" width="142" height="144" alt=""/></div>

<p class="drop-cap drop-t"><span class="upper-case">That</span> is, I used to hope
that they were returning.
My neighbor's small son,
Tony, aged six, needed
them. He needed them to learn to read
with. This was before I had any first-hand
evidence about modern school
methods. I saw school only through
Tony.</p>

<p>Tony was able to read, &ldquo;over to
school,&rdquo; such excerpts as the following:
&ldquo;The gingerbreadboy went clickety-clack
down the road.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sail far, sail
far, o'er the fabulous main!&rdquo; &ldquo;Consider,
goat, consider!&rdquo; &ldquo;You have
made a mistake, Mr. Alligator.&rdquo; Just
why, I reflected, should &ldquo;Mr. Alligator&rdquo;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" title="135"> </a>
and &ldquo;fabulous&rdquo; be introduced to a
pleasant child like Tony, who had not
as yet been allowed to meet &ldquo;cat,&rdquo;
&ldquo;dog,&rdquo; &ldquo;hen,&rdquo; &ldquo;red,&rdquo; &ldquo;boy,&rdquo; &ldquo;bad,&rdquo;
and a great many other creatures really
necessary to a little boy's existence?</p>

<p>His mother knew that Tony was not
learning to read very fast. She argued
with me a little on principle. She
said that James Whitcomb Riley wrote
&ldquo;fabulous.&rdquo; I reminded her in a neighborly
way that Mr. Milton wrote the
&ldquo;Areopagitica,&rdquo; thought by some to be
a good sort, but that, until Tony knew
his letters, the &ldquo;Areopagitica&rdquo; would
be almost wasted on him. I would have
stepped in at this point myself and
ponied him a bit, for pure love, had it
not been for the fact that I hated to
have him get a sensible A, B, or C
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" title="136"> </a>
mixed up with such corrupting associates
as a considering goat or a mistaken
alligator. And he would certainly
have mixed them up. He would never
have been able in this world to decide
in his little mind what relation &ldquo;consider&rdquo;
had to A,B,C. And he would
have been quite excusable.</p>

<p>I began to think that his mother was
too optimistic. She was trying to console
herself by the fact that, if she
should die, Tony could at least order
gingerbread off a menu card. But
could he? The sad fact that my neighbor
overlooked was that he didn't
know &ldquo;gingerbread&rdquo; when he saw it,
but just &ldquo;gingerbread<em>boy</em>&rdquo;! Perhaps
even at that, Tony might not have
starved, for even gingerbread<em>boys</em> are
edible, if Tony really could have recognized
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" title="137"> </a>
that. But he couldn't. Not
outside the confines of his &ldquo;reading-book&rdquo;&mdash;Heaven
save the mark! A
modern word-fiend tried to explain to
me here, that, after having learned
&ldquo;gingerbreadboy,&rdquo; a child comes naturally
by three words (and even four if
they allowed &ldquo;gin&rdquo; in the school curriculum)&mdash;namely,
&ldquo;ginger,&rdquo; &ldquo;bread,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;boy.&rdquo; But Tony didn't. I tried
him. He looked upon &ldquo;ginger&rdquo; as an
entire stranger, interesting in form,
perhaps, but still foreign. Something,
I was convinced, was wrong. And I
attributed this state to the fact that
Tony didn't know A, B, and C.</p>

<p>Just as I reached the high noon of
this conviction, I was drawn by the
most curious of circumstances into the
business of teaching little children to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" title="138"> </a>
read. I held the novel position of being
besought to bring all my heresies
and all my notions, and join the influenza-thinned
ranks of the teaching
profession. The Board of Education
said that it was desperate. It must
have been.</p>

<p>I suppose that no other power on
earth could have converted me so
quickly to the decried method, as my
being forced, out of loyalty to my employers,
to support it. I was plunged
on the first day&mdash;not into &ldquo;clickety-clack,&rdquo;
but &ldquo;slippety-slip.&rdquo; It was my
first object lesson to hear the laughter of
many little children, as the small gray
cat swallowed slippety-slip in rapid
succession the white goose, the cinnamon
bear, the great, big pig, and others
which have &ldquo;slippety-slipped&rdquo; my mind
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" title="139"> </a>
just now. It was easy to teach them
which fantastic word said &ldquo;slippety-slip.&rdquo;
It was very hard to teach them
which plain-faced word said &ldquo;and.&rdquo;
I was happy to find many fine old words
ranging themselves in the same category
as &ldquo;slippety-slip.&rdquo; &ldquo;Goose&rdquo; is
intrinsically easier to learn than &ldquo;duck&rdquo;;
&ldquo;red&rdquo; is a bagatelle beside &ldquo;blue.&rdquo;
But the easiest word of all is &ldquo;slippety-slip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took notes of phenomena like these,
for use later in dealing with critics who
theorized as I had theorized on the day
previous. I was not quite ready with
any solution on this first day when a
visiting mother assured me that she,
when a girl, was wont to read much
better when her book was open before
her. Her son, on the contrary, read better,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" title="140"> </a>
she told me, and with more interpretation
and fine feeling, without his
book. &ldquo;People think,&rdquo; said my visitor,
&ldquo;that when a child has his book open
and says aloud the words printed on
that page, that he is reading. He
may be,&rdquo; she added mildly, &ldquo;and then
again, of course, he mayn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I determined that, when this logical
lady should come again, her son should
be reading. So I taught him to read.
I taught him via the method I had disparaged;
via &ldquo;Mrs. Teapot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Goosey-Poosey-Loosey,&rdquo;
and the goat that
would not go home, without once mentioning
the names of A, B, or C. This
boy is in the third grade now, skimming
the &ldquo;Literary Digest&rdquo; for material for
his oral language.</p>

<p>The second step in my conversion
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" title="141"> </a>
occurred when one of the overworked
teachers showed me hastily how to
teach Phonics. She drew a flight of stairs
on the blackboard, and on each step she
placed a letter of the alphabet. I did
not find &ldquo;A&rdquo; among them, but I discerned
both B and C. To my surprise,
the little children knew these, but they
called them (as nearly as the printed
page can convey the sound) <em>buh</em> and
<em>kuh</em>. They called &ldquo;R&rdquo; <em>err</em>, and &ldquo;H&rdquo;
they called <em>huh</em>.</p>

<p>When I reached home, I looked up a
few letters in the Dictionary, and received
new light. Of what use is it,
after all, to know that &ldquo;W&rdquo; is called
&ldquo;Double-you,&rdquo; unless you know first
the sound for which it stands? The
Dictionary, in fact, explains that the
proper sound of this letter is really a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" title="142"> </a>
&ldquo;half u&rdquo; instead of a &ldquo;double u.&rdquo;
Certainly &ldquo;W&rdquo; is a more helpful tool
to a child when he has been taught to
pucker up his lips like the howling wind
when he sees this letter coming, than
when he has been taught to get set for
a &ldquo;d&rdquo; sound which is not there. Why
confuse a child's mind at first with
what a letter is arbitrarily called by
some one else? Surely it is more sensible
to show him what noise to make
when he sees it.</p>

<p>But I found that some of the children
did not connect the delightful game
of the blackboard stairs with their
reading at all. Tony was among this
number. Right here I was electrified
to find out the real trouble with
Tony. I found that it had not occurred
to him that the letter &ldquo;g,&rdquo; at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" title="143"> </a>
the beginning of the word &ldquo;good,&rdquo; for
instance, could have any part in distinguishing
this word from the Little
Red Hen. I found also that many of
the children were recognizing &ldquo;good-day
to you&rdquo; wholly by the quaint little
dash in the middle of &ldquo;good-day.&rdquo;
They shouted heartily &ldquo;good-day to
you&rdquo; whenever I showed them any
word containing a hyphen.</p>

<p>To remedy this difficulty, I abstracted
Phonics bodily from my afternoon
session, and inserted it directly before
the reading period in the morning.
In fact, I allowed a few Phonics to
spill over into Reading, and commenced
to read a little before the children
were quite finished with the staircase.
I can say that the greatest triumphal
moment of my life was when an
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" title="144"> </a>
entire class saw, independently and
suddenly and of themselves, that &ldquo;ice-cream&rdquo;
could not possibly be &ldquo;good-day
to you.&rdquo; And the fact that the
children now knew these apart by a
phonetic tool did not prevent them from
saying &ldquo;good-day to you&rdquo; just as cordially
and just as fast as before. Moreover,
they had not compelled the school
system to wait for them to spell out the
words letter by letter.</p>

<p>This is the only stage in a modern
phrase-and-sentence method which contains
a pitfall. If this is solidly bridged,
most children will learn to read more
understandingly than we used to. They
will read twice as well, and three times
as fast.</p>

<p>At the end of the school year, after
Tony had read nineteen books, I did
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" title="145"> </a>
throw in the alphabet itself as a classic.
We even sang it to the good old-fashioned
tune.</p>

<p>Tony will use A, B, and C, in the
Second Grade to spell with, and in the
Fourth Grade to look up words in the
Dictionary with; but he did not need
them, after all, in the First Grade, to
learn to read with.</p>

sick. In the days when
sickness was supposed to
be the result of possession by devils, the
healthy gathered around the invalid,
beating upon drums. When all disease
was supposed to be the chastening of
the Lord, they gathered at the bedside
again, teaching repentance of sins. And
in our own generation, they come again
around the sufferer telling him to take
his mind off himself.</p>

<p>I myself, being healthy, have never
been the victim of that form of ministration.
I have simply observed the effect
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_147" title="147"> </a>
of it on others. And since there is no
hope of converting the healthy from this
habit, the next best thing is to explain the
obscure workings of the healthy mind.</p>

<p>Of course, no two healthy people are
quite alike, and general statements
about any great composite type are dangerous.
But no matter how divergent
their styles, all up-to-date, unspoiled,
healthy persons can be trusted to make
certain stock remarks to or about the
sick. The context may vary, but sooner
or later the following phrases will crop
up: &ldquo;pulling yourself together&rdquo;; &ldquo;bracing
up&rdquo;; &ldquo;standing a little real hardship&rdquo;;
&ldquo;forgetting all about your aches
and pains&rdquo;; &ldquo;people who never have
<em>time</em> to be sick&rdquo;; &ldquo;people who are
worse off than you are&rdquo;; and, &ldquo;taking
your mind off yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" title="148"> </a>At any one of these cheery phrases, the
spirited sick man feels his gorge begin to
rise. He knows that if his gorge rises,
so will his temperature. With a mighty
effort he swallows his temper, and his
temperature goes up anyway at the exertion.
All this time he knows that his
visitor meant well, and he despises himself
for his irritation. He has no way of
defending himself, for, if he should describe
how ill he really is, would not that
convict him of having his mind on himself,
of craving sympathy, of &ldquo;enjoying
poor health&rdquo;? Over and over the words
of his visitor go ringing in his ears&mdash;words
intended tactfully to stimulate
recuperation. &ldquo;It's fine to see you looking
so well. All you need to do now is to
get something to take up your mind.
I know how hard it will be, for I have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" title="149"> </a>
been there myself, but circumstances
were such that <em>I</em> just <em>had</em> to brace up.
It would be the best thing in the world
for you if you only had to rough it a
little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any one of these remarks is guaranteed
to leave the person who is really
suffering in a very storm-beaten state
of mind, unless by the luckiest chance
he understands two basic facts about
the healthy: first, our healthy imagination;
second, our healthy ignorance.</p>

<p>The healthy imagination, in the first
place, cannot bear to move in circles.
Any novelist knows that a story must
progress. If the action is dramatic, the
final downfall or the final victory must
follow swiftly upon the heels of conflict.
The attention wanders if the story goes
monotonously along in the style of &ldquo;Another
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" title="150"> </a>
grasshopper came and brought
another grain of corn. And then another
grasshopper came and brought
another grain of corn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the same principle, the general
public gives intelligent understanding
to the great dangerous diseases where
there is a grand struggle of life and
death, where the sufferer grows rapidly
worse, reaches the crisis, hangs
for a moment between time and eternity,
and then either dies or gets well.
Here is the stuff of contest, the essence
of Greek drama: pity and fear, unity of
action, and dignity of conflict. The imagination
rises to it as to whirlwinds and
the noise of waterspouts. But when it
comes to the good friend who neither
dies nor gets well, who begins to recover
and succumbs again, travelling the monotonous
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" title="151"> </a>
round of one ill after another,
none of them fatal,&mdash;then the healthy
imagination stops following the circles.</p>

<p>It is time by every calculation that
our friend recovered. We hope that he
will soon be well and strong. He hopes
so, too, we admit broad-mindedly. But
most of us fall into generalities at this
point. We are not impatient <em>with</em> our
friend; we are impatient for him. A delayed
convalescence, we have heard, is
usually the result of mismanagement
somewhere; the wrong doctor, perhaps,
a family inclined to spoil by kindness,
or mind over matter imperfectly understood.
Suppose our sick friend could
get away from his anxious relatives, and
be suddenly cast upon a desert island;
would he not have to brace up and rattle
down his own cocoanuts with a will?
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" title="152"> </a>
We have known such cases&mdash;paralytics
who got thrown overboard and nimbly
swam ashore, rescuing women and children
on their way. Our friend is not an
extreme case like that, but, if he actually
had to get to work, would he not forget
all about his troubles, and suddenly
find himself cured?</p>

<p>Once having put him into the class of
needless suffering, we roll along merrily
to the moment when we decide that it is
time for us to speak. Let us speak tactfully,
by all means. Let us auto-suggest
as it were! Let those of us who are
amateurs do what we can in a quiet
way.</p>

<p>At this point, the healthy do three
things. We diagnose, we prescribe, and
we tell you to take your mind off yourself.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" title="153"> </a>This is where the healthy ignorance
comes in. When we are well, we think
of the mind as a convenient tool; in
Huxley's words, &ldquo;a cool, clear, logic engine.&rdquo;
We know that minor ailments of
our own have vanished when we have
vigorously taken our mind off our symptoms
and gone to the movies. We are
at our best, we know, when we have
given our whole attention to something
absorbing, quite outside ourselves; business,
friendship, good works. We feel
that our acquaintance will be the better
for this valuable thought. We do not
know that every other healthy person
in town has also decided that it is time
to pass on the same idea. Neither do
we realize that the ability to do as we
suggest is the sick person's idea of
heaven.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_154" title="154"> </a>Thinking thus masterfully of the
mind, we speak glibly of doing things
with it. We do not know how slippery
and complex a thing the mind is when
assailed by suffering. &ldquo;Take off your
mind.&rdquo; Take off your hat. We do not
know what long hours every invalid
spends driving his mind along on
every pleasant topic under the sun,
only to feel it skidding, skidding, from
side to side, just as you feel yourself
steering for the nearest tree when you
begin to drive a car. And after all this
effort, what has he been doing but putting
his mind on his mind? Less exhausting
to put it on the pain and be
done with it. When we urge our friend
not to steer for the tree, we feel that we
are presenting him with a new idea.</p>

<p>Healthy ignorance, in the second
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_155" title="155"> </a>
place, assumes that the mind of a sick
person is more than normally susceptible
to suggestion. We have heard that, if
you say to a patient, &ldquo;How thin you
are,&rdquo; he will instantly feel thinner and
thinner, will droop and wilt and brood
morbidly upon his state. Very well,
then. We go to visit our friend resolved
to make no such unfortunate remark.
We conceal our shock at the changed
appearance of our friend, but we cannot
help thinking about it. Every
healthy person is a trifle taken aback
when he sees anybody else laid low. The
neat white corners of the counterpane
lend an awe-inspiring geometrical effect;
if the patient is a man, he looks subtly
changed without his high collar; if the
patient is a lady, she is transformed
with her hair in braids. We know that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_156" title="156"> </a>
we must not cry, &ldquo;How changed you
are, Grandmother,&rdquo; lest we send the patient
into a relapse. It is a poor rule
that will not work both ways. If a comment
on frail appearance would thus
depress our friend, surely the contrary
assurance ought to chirk him up in proportion.
We therefore say blithely,
&ldquo;Well, you certainly do look fine!&rdquo;
Then later we perhaps repeat it, to make
sure that auto-suggestion has a chance
to set in.</p>

<p>Now, personally, if somebody told
me that I looked well, I feel that I could
manage to bear up. But in the sick-room,
the remark seldom makes a hit.
Nine chances out of ten the patient does
not understand the healthy. He feels
that we suspect him of rusticating in
bed under false pretences. He does not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_157" title="157"> </a>
want to be ill, nor to look ill; but since
he <em>is</em> ill, he would be sorry to have us
think that he might as well be up and
about. He does not know that we
adopt the cheery note to avoid the
fatal opposite, and to encourage him.
He does not know how helpless we are,
nor how sure of the susceptibility of
the stricken mind.</p>

<p>All these traits of the healthy imagination
and the healthy ignorance are
magnified tenfold if the invalid's disorder
is nervous. To the untutored
layman, a nervous disorder means
an imaginary disorder. What nervous
wreck has not prayed to exchange his
baffling torments for something showy
and spectacular, like broken bones or
Spotted Fever? The healthiest imagination
can grasp a broken leg. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_158" title="158"> </a>
healthiest ignorance can see that it
should lie for a while in splints, and
that we cannot help our friend by urging
him, however tactfully, to forget
all about his fracture and join us on a
hike. But disordered nerves are different.
Everybody admits that. We feel
instantly competent to prescribe. We
have read up on psychotherapy, in the
magazines.</p>

<p>Having diagnosed the case, having
prescribed remedies, we feel a trace of
impatience if our friend seems not
quite cured.</p>

<p>In addition to our eager way of giving
advice, we who are healthy have also
a way of confusing cause and effect.
When our patient finally does succeed
in building up his vitality to the point
where he can resume his work, when
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_159" title="159"> </a>
we see him going busily about the
world again taking his share of hard
knocks without flinching, then we say,
&ldquo;There! Didn't we say he'd be better
the minute he had something to do?&rdquo;
We know nothing about the times when
he hoped that he had recovered, attempted
to take up work again, and
succumbed. We see only the triumphant
emerging of his renewed vitality.
To us the cause is obvious, just what
we had been prescribing all along.
When he was idle, he was ill. Now that
he is busy, he is well. Could anything
be more logical? Therefore, when we
find him working hard at his old profession,
we smile indulgently upon him
and we say, &ldquo;That's right! It will do
you good! <em>Now</em> you have something to
take your mind off your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_160" title="160"> </a>But I will not repeat it. Never in all
my life shall I say that beautiful and
grammatical phrase again. There is
probably a good deal in it&mdash;how much,
I, for one, have not the least idea.
Probably there are invalids in the world
who would be completely cured if they
could be worried into hard work at all
costs, &ldquo;roughing it&rdquo; with a vengeance.
We stray perilously near the fields contested
by experts when we come to
that. The point is that the subject will
always be a field for experts, and that
never in the long history of suffering
was very much accomplished by
the well-meant exhortations of friends.
As far back as Old Testament days,
friends came to see a patient man, and
reasoned at length with him. And he
cried unto the Lord.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" title="161"> </a>Nearly every invalid loves his
friends. He cannot bear to have them
misunderstand him. And yet, if he
only understands <em>them</em>&mdash;if he understands
the healthy as a class, with our
healthy imaginations, our healthy ignorance,
our superstitions, and all our
simple ways, the most desolate Job in a
friend-strewn world can afford to brandish
his potsherd and take cheer. He
will know the explanation of our kindly
words, and their proper discount at the
bank. And perhaps he may be able
finally, with a prodigious effort of his
will, to take them off his mind.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" title="162"> </a>CARVING AT TABLE</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/cap-c.png" width="148" height="150" alt=""/></div>

<p class="drop-cap drop-t"><span class="upper-case">Carving</span> at table is one
of the most virile things
that a man can do, and
yet it usually has to be
done according to feminine standards.
It is a primitive art overlaid with
a complex technique, a pioneer act in
a dainty environment. For so masterful
a deed with an edged tool, a man
should be allowed the space and freedom
of the Maine woods. Environed
by the modern tablecloth, he must be
not only masterful but cautious; not
so much fearless as adroit.</p>

<p>The process tests not only the man
himself, but also his relations with his
wife. When a married couple feel
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" title="163"> </a>
equally responsible for an act at which
only one of them can officiate, they
are tempted to exchange remarks. The
most tactful wife yields now and then
to the impulse to do a little coaching
from the side-lines, and many husbands
have been known to reply with a few
well-chosen words about the knife.
They sometimes carry on quite a little
responsive service. This happens occasionally
even when the husband is an
artist at his work. The ideals of two
artists will occasionally conflict. And
even the model wife, who ignores the
carving and engages the guests in
conversation until the worst is over,
will at times find herself clutching the
tablecloth or holding her breath at the
critical points&mdash;when the drum-stick
is being detached from the second
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" title="164"> </a>
joint, for instance, or when the knife
hovers over the guest's portion of the
steak. These two crises are the great
moments for the man who carves.</p>

<p>In fact, you have not taken the complete
measure of a man until you have
seen him carve both steak and fowl.
These two make totally different demands
upon the worker. The chicken
calls for a sense of structure, a versatile
skill in manœuvring for position, and
the delicate wrist of the violinist. But
your true porterhouse calls for shrewd
judgment and clear-cut decisions, with
no halfway measures or reconsiderations
at all. With the chicken, you can
modify, slice, combine, arrange to best
advantage on the plate. With the steak,
you work in the flat and in one color;
every stroke must count. There are
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" title="165"> </a>
men who would rather parcel out the
Balkans than map a steak.</p>

<p>Great artists in carving are of several
classes: those who stand up to their
work and those who remain seated;
those who talk and those who do not.
I recall one noble old aristocrat, with
the eye of a connoisseur and the suavity
of an Italian grandee, who stood above
the great turkey that he had to carve
and discoursed with us as follows, pronouncing
every word with the dramatic
vigor that I try to indicate by the spelling,
and illustrating each remark with
one deft motion of his knife; this was his
monologue: &ldquo;Now, we cut off his Legg....
Now, we take his Winng!...
And now,&mdash;we <em>Slice</em> him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To my mind, this conversation is
about the only sort in which the successful
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" title="166"> </a>
carver can afford to indulge.
The nervous amateur thinks it necessary
to keep up a run of wise comment
on the topics of the day to show that he
is at ease; or perhaps he does it as the
magician talks when he puts the rabbits
into his hat, to distract the spectators'
attention from his minor tactics. But
he might as well learn that he cannot
distract us. The matter is too close to
our hearts. It is natural to watch the
carving intently, not necessarily with
an eye to our own interests, but because
for the moment the platter is the
dramatic centre of the group. Action,
especially in an affair demanding skill,
irresistibly holds the eye. The well-bred
guest chats along of one thing and
another, but his eye strays absently
toward the roast.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_167" title="167"> </a>This is very hard upon the newly married
husband. Spectators add immensely
to his difficulties. Some years ago, one
such bridegroom, now an experienced
host and patriarch, was about to carve
a chicken for his bride and her one guest.
I was the guest, and at that time I
held theories about the married state.
While we were setting the table, I had
mentioned a few of these, among them
my belief that all little boys should be
taught the rudiments of carving, so
that when married they would know
how to preside correctly at their own
tables. My friend the bride agreed with
me, and supported my views by anecdotes
from real life. The anecdotes
were about boys who had not been
so trained. Meanwhile the bridegroom
listened intently from his post on the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_168" title="168"> </a>
kitchen table. Young women are likely
to forget that young men have feelings,
especially if they have been trained
by brothers who displayed none. We
therefore went on at great length. Carving,
we said, was not an instinct, but
a craft.</p>

<p>As we sat at soup, the young husband
became more and more uneasy,
and when the chicken made its appearance
he leaned back with beads of perspiration
on his brow. &ldquo;After all this,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I hope nobody expects me to
carve that chicken. I'll just pass it
around, and you girls chip off what you
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The central difficulty in carving,
however, is found not so much in the
actual chipping as in the tactful distribution
of choice parts. This matter
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" title="169"> </a>
is complicated by the fact that unselfish
people will lie about their preferences,
polite people will refuse to disclose
them, and critical people expect you to
remember them. Even the expert carver,
therefore, looks with favor on those
convenient meats that come naturally
in individual units&mdash;croquettes, cutlets,
chops, sausages; here the only difficulty
is the choice between brown and
not so brown, large and small. There is
only the mathematical matter of making
the food go around, and the man
with the vaguest sense of proportion
can count chops and divide by the
number of guests.</p>

<p>But when the company is large, and
the platter of steak just adequate, there
really is cause for anxiety. Some carvers,
under such circumstances, begin cautiously,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_170" title="170"> </a>
serving small helpings at first
until they are sure they are safe, and
then becoming gradually more lavish.
Others begin recklessly, and have to
retrench. A group of college students
once made a study of this matter with
data and statistics that would have
adorned a doctor's degree. The object
was to locate the seat at any table of
fourteen where one could count on the
most even diet, the golden mean between
feast and famine, no matter
which member of the faculty chanced
to carve. There were many variables
to be considered: some members of the
faculty habitually carved with giant
portions at first, and then dwindled
suddenly; others varied from day to
day, profiting at one meal by what they
learned at the last. A few were expert
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_171" title="171"> </a>
dividers by fourteen. The conclusion
was reached after weeks of minute toil.
Like all great investigators, these students
were prepared to warrant their
findings for all time. The best seat at
a table of fourteen&mdash;the one where
you can count on the least fluctuation
and the largest security&mdash;in short,
Whitman's Divine Average&mdash;is the
fifth seat from the professor, left.
Things in that position run, barring
accidents, quite well. If caution was
the slogan at the outset, the plentiful
supply on the platter has by that time
begun to tell upon the mind of the
carver, and things are looking up. If the
first helpings were extravagant, there
has still not been quite time to feel the
real pinch of want. Fifth seat from the
professor, left.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_172" title="172"> </a>Of course, fourteen is too large a
number to divide by. When it comes
to long division, brain-fag is bound to set
in. Since those days, I am told, food in
that college is sent in ready apportioned
in advance.</p>

<p>We should miss something in our
homes, however, if the art of carving
should decline. There is a certain symbolic
grace in the fatherly act of hewing
away at a large roast, even if a man
does not do it so very well. It is true
that a great many pleasant gentlemen
do not feel quite at home when dealing
with a meat; they do not feel quite at
their best. They carve tentatively,
parcelling it out at random. Until they
come to their own serving, they are
vague. At that point, however, the
most helpless amateur takes on cheer.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_173" title="173"> </a>
Watch him as he settles himself more
comfortably, draws up the platter at a
better angle, and selects the fragments
of his choice. It is here that he does his
best carving, not consciously, not at all
selfishly, but because he now feels sure.
He has something to go by. He knows
what he wants.</p>

<p>After all, the task of carving at table
is not an infallible test of man. Some
of the most uncertain carvers in the
world are great and good men, standing
high in their professions and revered
by a family who must nevertheless
shiver for the fate of the table-linen
when the sirloin steak comes on. But
the fact remains that the man who can
carve equitably, neatly, and with discrimination
has nearly always a balanced
brain and a reliable self-command.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_174" title="174"> </a>
In an army test he would stand
high. He is your genuine &ldquo;officer material.&rdquo;
And he is very scarce.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_175" title="175"> </a>THE FEELING OF IRRITATION</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/cap-t.png" width="142" height="144" alt=""/></div>

<p class="drop-cap drop-t"><span class="upper-case">The</span> feeling of irritation in
its earliest form once overtook
a little girl whose mother
had enforced a wholesome
bit of discipline. In a great state
of wrath the little girl went to her room,
got out a large sheet of paper, and ruled
it heavily down the middle. Then she
headed one column &ldquo;People I Like,&rdquo;
and crowded that half of the sheet
with the names of all her acquaintances.
The other half of the page she headed
&ldquo;People I Don't Like,&rdquo; and in that column
listed one word only&mdash;&ldquo;Mama.&rdquo;
This done, she locked the grim document
in her safe-deposit box, and hid
the key.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" title="176"> </a>That glowering deed was the very
ritual of irritation. The feeling of irritation
is not merely one of heat; it is
a tall wave of violent dislike that goes
mounting up our blood. When we have
it, it feels permanent. Our friend is not
what we thought he was&mdash;our family
is not what it should be&mdash;our job
is a failure&mdash;we have placed our affections
in the wrong quarter. When
young politicians have this feeling,
they bolt the ticket; when young employees
have it, they resign. The first
time when young married people have
it, they think that love is dead. If
they have too much wealth and leisure,
they fly apart and eventually get a
decree. But in households where the
budget does not cover alimony, they
commonly stay together and see for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_177" title="177"> </a>
themselves how the wave of wrath
goes down. The material inconveniences
of resignations, abscondings, law-suits,
and the like have been a great safeguard
in many a career. Nothing in
Barrie's plays is more subtle than the
perfect moment when the young couple
decide to postpone separation until
the laundry comes home.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to be a &ldquo;temperamental&rdquo;
person or a fire-eater of any
sort in order to know how it feels to
be irritated&mdash;and irritating. The gentlest
folk are capable of both sensations.
Any one who has seen a lovely lady
deliberately stir up strife in the bosom
of a genial story-teller, by correcting his
facts for him and exposing his fictions,
will remember the tones of restrained
choler with which the merry tale progressed.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" title="178"> </a>
Who has not remarked to a
kind relative, &ldquo;Well, if you know so
much about it, why don't you tell it
yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no ratio or proportion at all
between the cause of irritation and the
ensuing state of mind. In our moments
of ferment we lose the faculty of discrimination.
We hardly ever refer our
exasperation to the trivial detail that
brought it on. We feel that the detail
is simply an indication of the great
flaws in the whole situation. We have
a crow to pluck, not only with our
friend, but&mdash;to use the words of
Quiller-Couch&mdash;with everything that
appertains to that potentate.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that we are at
loggerheads with a fellow-member of a
public-welfare committee. He opposes
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_179" title="179"> </a>
a measure that we endorse. He will not
see reason. We therefore refer him to
his class: he is a typical politician, a
single-track mind, a combination of
Mugwump and Boss Tweed. We ourselves,
meanwhile, are a blend of Martin
Luther, John Huss, and the prophet
Isaiah, with tongs from the altar.</p>

<p>Or perhaps we are irritated with a
colleague on a teaching-staff after the
events of a varied day. Irrelevant matters
have happened all the morning in
amazing succession: an itinerant janitor
filling inkwells; an inkwell turning
turtle&mdash;blotters rushed to flood-sufferers;
an electrician with tall step-ladder
and scaling-irons to repair the electric
clock; a fire-drill in examination period;
one too many revolutions of the pencil-sharpener;
one too many patriotic
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_180" title="180"> </a>
&ldquo;drives&rdquo; involving the care of public
moneys kept in a candy-box. And now
our zealous academic friend calls an
unexpected committee meeting to tabulate
the results of intelligence-tests.</p>

<p>We are in no mood for intelligence-tests.
We object. He persists. We
take umbrage. He still calls the meeting.
Then, up rears the wave of dislike
and irritation, not at the details that
have brought us to our crusty state&mdash;not
dislike of ink and electricity and
patriotism and intelligence&mdash;but dislike
of our friend and of the Art of
Teaching that he represents. The
trouble with our friend, we decide, is
his academic environment. He is over-educated&mdash;attenuated;
a Brahmin.
Nobody in touch with Real Life could
be so thoroughly a mule and an opinionist.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" title="181"> </a>
Better get out of this ultra-civilized
atmosphere before our own beautiful
catholicity of thought is cramped,
crippled, like his. At these moments
we do not stop to remember that people
are opinionated also on the island of
Yap.</p>

<p>Most frequently of all, we apply our
dudgeon to the kind of community in
which we live. We are nettled at a bit
of criticism that has reached our ears.
Instantly we say cutting things about
the narrow ways of a small community,
with page-references to &ldquo;Main Street&rdquo;
and the Five Towns. We forget that
our friends in great cities might be
quite as chatty. Margot Asquith lives
and thrives in crowds.</p>

<p>We refer our irritation, also, to types.
Any skirmish in a women's organization
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_182" title="182"> </a>
is referred to women and their catty
ways. Any Church or Red Cross breeze
is an example of the captious temper of
the godly. All friction between soldiers
of different nations is a sign of Race
Antagonism; the French are not what
we had inferred from Lafayette.</p>

<p>In short, the whole history and
literature of dissension shows that
people have always tried to make their
irritations prove something about certain
types, or situations, or nations, or
communities. Whereas the one thing
that has been eternally proved is the
fact that human beings are irritable.</p>

<p>If we accept that fact as a normal
thing, we find ourselves ready for one
more great truth. Violent irritation
produced on small means is a deeply
human thing, a delicately unbalanced
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" title="183"> </a>
thing, something to reckon with, and
something from which we eventually
recover on certain ancient and well-recognized
lines. When our feeling is at
its height, we are ready to throw away
anything, smash anything, burn all
bridges. Nothing is too valuable to cast
into the tall flame of our everlasting
bonfire. This sounds exaggerated.
Emotion remembered in tranquillity
is a pallid thing, indeed. But it is hot
enough at the time. The whole range
of sensation and emotion may be travelled
in an hour, at a pace incredible&mdash;a
sort of round-trip survey of the
soul.</p>

<p>The father of a large family sat in
church at one end of a long pew. His
wife sat at the other end of the pew,
with a row of sons, daughters, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_184" title="184"> </a>
guests ranged in the space between.
Near the close of the sermon one morning,
the father glanced down the line,
gazed for a horrified moment at his
eldest daughter, Kate, got out his pencil,
wrote a few words on a scrap of
paper, put the paper into his hat, and
passed the hat down the line. As the
hat went from hand to hand, each member
of the family peered in, read the
message, glanced at Kate, and began to
shake as inconspicuously as is ever possible
in an open pew. Kate, absorbed
in the sermon, was startled by a nudge
from her brother, who offered her the
hat, with note enclosed. She looked in
and read, &ldquo;Tell Kate that her mouth is
partly open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate remembered that it must have
been. The whole pew was quivering
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" title="185"> </a>
with seven concentrated efforts at self-control.</p>

<p>Now, one would think that a moment
like this would be jolly even for
the cause of laughter in others. But it
was not. Kate knew that they had
been laughing before the note reached
her, and she was hurt. If they loved her
as she loved them, they would not want
to laugh. She set her jaw like iron, and
looked straight ahead. This started
them all off again. With the instinct of
a well-trained elder sister, she knew
that if she wanted any peace she ought
to turn and smile and nod cordially all
down the row, as at a reception. But it
was too late for that. She had taken
the proud line, and she would follow it.</p>

<p>As her expression grew more austere,
the boys grew more convulsed. Aloof
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" title="186"> </a>
now, cut off from her kin entirely, she
sat seething. Floods of scarlet anger
drowned the sermon's end. The closing
hymn was given out, but she declined
the offered half of her brother's hymnal.
&ldquo;Tell Kate she can open it now,&rdquo; telegraphed
one of the boys as the congregation
began to sing. Here was Kate's
chance to unbend and join the group
and nod and smile again, but she was
too far gone. She received the message
with lifted eyebrows, and stood with
cold pure profile averted until after the
benediction. Then she turned away
from her reeling family, and walked off
in a white heat. Her anger was not at
her father whose note caused the stir.
She had no resentment toward him at
all. If one's mouth is open, one would
wish to be advised of the fact. Her feeling
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_187" title="187"> </a>
was the mighty wrath of the person
who has been laughed at before being
told the joke. Unwilling to face her
family, she went up to take dinner at
her grandmother's house, that refuge
for all broken hearts.</p>

<p>After dinner, Kate looked out of the
window and saw her family coming up
the drive. They filed into the house
and gathered in a group. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo;
said one of the boys, &ldquo;that in the
cause of friendship we owe Kate an
apology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grand manner of formal apology
from one's relatives is the most disarming
thing in the world. Friendly conversation
flowed back into the normal
at once. But it was years before it was
quite safe for Kate to rest her chin on
her hand in church.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" title="188"> </a>Very often our most genuine irritations
appear unreasonable to our
friends. For instance, why should
people object to being called by each
other's names? Two brilliant young
lawyers once developed animosity
against each other because their names
Stacey and Stanton were constantly
interchanged. Children suffer from this
sort of thing continually; grown people
tend to confuse brothers and to call
them by one another's names promiscuously.
We may love our brother tenderly,
and yet not like to be confounded
with him. Even parents sometimes
make slips. The smallest boy in a lively
family had a mother who used to call
the roll of all her children's names,
absent-mindedly, before she hit upon
the right one. Consequently, the smallest
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_189" title="189"> </a>
boy learned to respond to the
names George, Alice, Christine, and
Amos. But the thing had happened to
him once too often. One morning he
came down to breakfast with a large
square of cardboard pinned to his
bosom; and on the placard in large letters
was printed the word &ldquo;Henry.&rdquo;
Rather go through life with a tag
around his neck than be called Alice
any more.</p>

<p>All these capricious facts about irritability
rather explode the old adage
that it takes two to make a quarrel. If
we are really on the rampage, the other
person may be a perfect pacifist and
still call down our ire. We can make
the hot-foot excursion to the heights of
madness, for instance, when a friend
with whom we are arguing whistles
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" title="190"> </a>
softly away to himself while we talk.
Even worse is the person who sings a
gay little aria after we are through. In
the presence of such people, we feel like
the college girl who became annoyed
with her room-mate, and, reflecting
prudently upon the inconveniences of
open war, rushed out of the room and
down the stairs to relieve her feelings
by slamming the front door. She tore
open the great door with violent hands,
braced it wide, and flung it together
with all her might. But there was no
crash. It was the kind of door that
shuts with an air-valve, and it closed
gradually, tranquilly, like velvet; a
perfect lady of a door. People who sing
and hum and whistle softly to themselves
while we rage, are like that door.</p>

<p>Knowing that human beings are occasionally
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_191" title="191"> </a>
irritable, that they can recover
from their irritation, and that we
can also recover from ours, why is it
that we ever hold resentment long?
Some people, like soap-stones, hold
their heat longer than others; but the
mildest of us, even after we have quite
cooled off, sometimes find ourselves
warming up intermittently at the mere
memory of the fray. We are like the old
lady who said that she could forgive
and forget, but she couldn't help thinking
about it. We love our friend as
much as ever, but one or two of the
things he said to us do stay in mind.
The dumb animals have an immense
advantage over us in this regard. They
may be able to communicate, but their
language has presumably fewer descriptive
adjectives than ours. Words
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_192" title="192"> </a>
spoken in the height of irritation are
easily memorized. They have an epigrammatic
swing, and a racy Anglo-Saxon
flavor all their own. Unless we
are ready to discount them entirely,
they come into our minds in our pleasantest
moods, checking our impulses of
affection, and stiffening our cordial
ways.</p>

<p>On this account, the very proud and
the very young sometimes let a passing
rancor estrange a friend. When we are
young, and fresh from much novel-reading,
we are likely to think of love as a
frail and perishable treasure&mdash;something
like a rare vase, delicate, and
perfect as it stands. One crash destroys
it forever. But love that involves the
years is not a frail and finished crystal.
It is a growing thing. It is not even a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_193" title="193"> </a>
simple growing thing, like a tree. A
really durable friendship is a varied
homelike country full of growing things.
We cannot destroy it and throw it
away. We can even have a crackling
bonfire there without burning up the
world. Fire is dangerous, but not final.</p>

<p>Of course, it is in our power to let a
single conflagration spoil all our love, if
we burn the field all over and sow it
with salt, and refuse to go there ever
again. But after the fires have gone
down on the waste tract, the stars wheel
over and the quiet moon comes out&mdash;and
forever afterwards we have to skirt
hastily around that territory in our
thought. It is still there, the place that
once was home.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is trifling and perverse to
be harking back to nature and to childhood
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" title="194"> </a>
for parables. But sometimes there
is reassurance in the simplest things.
The real war-god in our own family was
Geoffrey, and Barbara was his prophet.
Many a doughty battle they waged
when they both happened to be in the
mood. Whenever Barbara wanted a
little peace, she used to take her dolls
to the attic, saying to our mother as
she went, &ldquo;K. G.&rdquo; This meant, &ldquo;Keep
Geoffrey.&rdquo; But one time Barbara was
very ill. Geoffrey was afraid that she
was going to die, and showered her with
attentions assiduously. He even gathered
flowers for her every day. The
trained nurse was much impressed.
One afternoon, when the crisis was
passed, the nurse told Geoffrey that she
thought that he was very sweet, indeed,
to his little sick sister. Geoffrey was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_195" title="195"> </a>
squatting on the arm of the sofa, watching
Barbara with speculative eye. He
considered this new light on his character
for a moment, and then remarked,
&ldquo;Well, you just wait until she gets her
strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We live in cantankerous days. Anybody
who has enough energy to do anything
particular in the world has more
or less difficulty in getting on with
people. Unless he chooses to take his
dolls to the attic, he is in for occasional
criticisms, laughter, interruptions, and
the experience of being called by names
that are not his own. The world sends
flowers to the dying, but not to people
when they get their strength. It is the
very rare person, indeed, who goes
through life with nothing to ruffle him
at all.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" title="196"> </a>In moments of irritation at all this,
we unconsciously divide the world into
two columns: people who agree with us
and people who do not; &ldquo;People I
Like,&rdquo; and &ldquo;People I Don't Like.&rdquo;
Instinctively we make the lists, and
file them away. If we could lay hands
on the ghostly files of twenty years and
scan them through, we should find that
the black-lists were not a catalogue of
permanent and bitter hatreds, but a
sort of Friendship Calendar. Many of
our collisions, after all, were with the
people to whom we came most near.</p>

<p>Almost every one wants to be easy
to get along with. Some of us find it
hard. In those discouraging moments
when we have proved obnoxious to our
friends, we are inclined to feel that a
policy of isolation would be the most
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_197" title="197"> </a>
attractive thing in the world. But
there are practical drawbacks even to
isolation.</p>

<p>A blizzard had once drifted all the
streets of our town. Our mother, with
the true pioneering spirit, decided that
she was going out. Our father was
urging her to wait until the streets were
cleared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Endicott,&rdquo; said our mother
reasonably, &ldquo;the snow-plough has been
down, and there's a path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; persisted Father, &ldquo;the wind
has drifted it all in again.&rdquo; He paused
while she put on her hat, and then he
added earnestly, &ldquo;You don't know how
windy and drifted it really is. I just
saw Mrs. Muldoon coming down the
street, and she was going along single
file, and making hard work of it too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_198" title="198"> </a>The family was immensely taken
with the picture of Mrs. Muldoon's
ample figure going downtown in single-file
formation; but, in spite of the jeers
of his audience, our father still insisted
that Mrs. Muldoon <em>was</em> going single
file, and that she <em>was</em> making hard
work of it at that.</p>

<p>Now and then there is an extreme
individualist who yearns to go through
life absolutely unmolested, single file.
He is impatient of collisions, and collisions
certainly do occur through one's
proximity to one's kind. But even the
most arrant individualist can hardly
go single file all by himself&mdash;not without
making hard work of it, at least.
And even if such a thing were possible
it would not be a natural or kindly
way of life. Our hardy race has always
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" title="199"> </a>
valued the strength that comes from
contacts of every sort and kind. We
therefore keep up the hearty old custom
of going through life in groups of families
and associates and friends&mdash;even
though, inadvertently, we sometimes
do collide.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
